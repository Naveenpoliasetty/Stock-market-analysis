A significant structural trend in the market is the sustained flows into equity mutual funds which are gathering momentum. ""This will ensure resilience of the market with dips getting bought,"" said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. Midcaps have again become the segment of activity, particularly by retail investors. This is because there is no institutional selling pressure in midcaps unlike in largecaps where institutions including FIIs have large holdings. ""Financials are likely to lead the rally along with capital goods and automobiles in early April. Credit growth in the economy is impressive at around 20 percent and this will help boost banks’ profitability. Q4 results of banks will be good,"" he added. Technical view ""Nifty is trading in a tight range in the last week of March before the monthly expiry. On the lower side, 21,800 is the strong support and 22,200 is the strong resistance. Traders are advised to buy Nifty on dips with a strict stop loss of 21,800 levels on a closing basis,"" said Deven Mehata, Research Analyst, Choice Broking. Traders should limit their exposure and prefer hedged trades, with a focus on index majors and large midcaps, Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research, Religare Broking Ltd, said.

The Sensex closed 655.04 points or 0.90 percent higher at 73,651.35, and the Nifty rose 203.20 points or 0.92 percent to 22,326.90. About 1,738 shares advanced, 1959 declined, and 102 were unchanged. Here are the 5 factors driving the rally today: Financials rise Financials rose after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) eased recently tightened rules for lender investments in alternative investment funds (AIFs). Instead of a 100 percent provision, banks now only need to set aside funds for the portion of their investment in an AIF that is further invested in debtor companies. Nifty Bank and Nifty PSU Bank indices rose over a percent. ICICI Bank and State Bank of India were among the top gainers on Nifty, rising 1.6 and 1.9 percent. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Index heavyweightsBajaj FinanceandBajaj Finservrose about 4 percent each following a Moneycontrol report that Bajaj Housing Finance had initiated preliminary talks with several investment banks about a potential initial public offering (IPO). Sharp rally in other heavyweights such asHero MotoCorp, M&M, JSW Steel also lifted the Nifty 50 above the 22,450 level. Strong global cues US stocks ended higher overnight, with the Dow leading gains and the S&P 500 setting a closing record. Asian and European markets also gained as ahead of the much-anticipated US core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation. Investors expect inflation to shrink leading to the Fed cutting rates from June onwards. Steven Blitz, TS Lombard’s chief U.S. economist believes, markets will continue to rally even if the Federal Reserve chooses not to cut interest rates this year. Strong FII inflows Foreign portfolio investors bought Indian equities worth Rs 2,170 crore on a net basis in the previous session, while domestic institutional investors purchased a net Rs 1,198 core worth of stocks. After remaining net sellers in the past two months, FIIs have turned buyers in March and have bought shares worth Rs 3,000 crore, so far, this month. The rise in FPI inflows comes on the back of improving macros, declining inflation, hopes of rate cuts from June and the possibility of the Modi government returning for a third term. The record-high performance of domestic equities and robust financial activity also aided the positive sentiment. Also Read |Bajaj Finance arm Bajaj Housing Finance starts preparation for IPO targeting $9-10 billion valuation Macho Macros Strong macro forecast also pushed markets higher on March 28. Morgan Stanley has raised India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for FY25 to 6.8 percent from its previous estimate of 6.5 percent, highlighting the country’s strength and stability as hallmarks of the current financial cycle. It also revised its growth forecast for FY24 to 7.9 percent. More importantly, the earnings growth in India is expected to remain strong, going forward. Cyclically, India looks well-positioned and the domestic cyclical sectors should do well. Technical factor The short-term technical and sentiment indicators turned extremely oversold leading to a correction in the market. A bounce was due from there, Jay Vora, market analyst at Indiacharts.com, said. ""Now, 22,526 is a major resistance level for the Nifty on the upside. Below this level, a correction could still be in place. However, if the index manages to breach this level, the positive momentum could continue in the near term,"" he said. If the 22,526 is surpassed on the upside, largecaps could outperform because they will be relatively stronger.

ASTERDM India’s EBITDA increased sharply over last 3 years (30% CAGR over FY20-23) and growth momentum continued in FY24 with ~30% YoY growth. We estimate 29% pre IND AS EBITDA CAGR from India business over FY24-26E aided by scale up in margins, healthy ARPOB and bed additions. At current market price, adjusted for GCC and minority stake, the India business is trading at 17x EV/EBITDA on FY26E respectively which is at 15- 40% discount to listed peers. We believe such steep discount is unwarranted given similar growth profile. Outlook We maintain ‘BUY’ rating with revised TP of Rs515 (earlier Rs. 500) valuing India hospital segment at 22x EV/EBITDA on FY26E EBITDA.

On April 2, the market has saw consolidation and closed moderately lower because of recovery in the last hour of trade. The Nifty 50 fell 9 points to 22,453 and formed a Doji kind of candlestick pattern on the daily charts, while the BSE Sensex declined 111 points to 73,904. The broader markets continued to outperform the benchmark indices as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 1.2 percent each, while the declining volatility remained quite supportive for bulls, as the India VIX declined 3.55 percent to 11.65 level, the lowest closing level in current calendar year. Stocks that recorded healthy gains on the day of consolidation included Steel Authority of India, Bharat Electronics, and IRCTC.Steel Authority of Indiahas seen a decisive breakout of downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of February 7 and March 4, and clocked 5 percent rally at Rs 148 on the NSE. The stock has formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, with healthy volumes, while the stock traded above all key moving averages. Bharat Electronicsdecisively surpassed its previous record high and rallied 4.7 percent to end at record closing high of Rs 221. The stock has formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe with robust volumes, while the stock traded above all key moving averages. IRCTChas seen a breakout of horizontal resistance trendline adjoining multiple touchpoints and climbed 3.5 percent to Rs 1,003.8. The stock has formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with above average volumes, while trading above all key moving averages. Here's what Riyank Arora of Mehta Equities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: SAIL The stock has touched an important resistance zone of Rs 148.40 - 150.00 on its daily timeframe charts. With the RSI (relative strength index - 14) on the daily timeframe being 68.74, the momentum indicates a strong uptrend in the stock. An immediate support is placed at Rs 143 mark, below which the stock would lose its strength. On the upside, a breakout above Rs 151 should trigger an up-move in the stock towards Rs 157.50 and Rs 160 gradually over time. We advise traders to keep a trailing stop-loss at Rs 143 mark for all open positions in the stock.  Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation(IRCTC) The stock has given a good breakout above its recent swing high resistance mark of Rs 989.90 and successfully managed to close above the same. Anchor VWAP (volume-weighted average price) suggests a major support placed near Rs 940 mark, a closing below which should trigger a downside move in the stock. On the upside, however, targets are maintained near Rs 1,050 and above. We advise short-term investors to keep a strict stop-loss at Rs 940 mark on a daily closing basis in the stock. Bharat Electronics The stock has given a good breakout above its all-time high resistance mark of Rs 216.80 on the daily charts. With the RSI (14) on daily charts being near 69.70 and the stock witnessing a sharp surge in volumes, with the volume being nearly 3 times its average (30) days traded volumes - the stock looks poised for an upside move towards Rs 240 and Rs 250 in a spree of momentum rally. Any pullback towards Rs 217-218 should offer a good buy on the stock. We advise traders to keep a strict stop-loss at Rs 212 mark on a daily closing basis.

Once the future volumes on these products exceed the threshold of INR8-10b (one-year average ADTO) options, contracts will also be launched. Retail participation in the Indian commodities market (1.4m UCCs) is low when compared to equity market participation (40m NSE active clients). Strong technology-based offerings from discount brokers, along with lower ticket-size contracts from MCX, can improve the participation significantly. FPIs, last year, received approval from the regulator to invest in cash-settled commodities. In a follow-up to the same, MCX has launched its direct market access (DMA) facility for Category-I FPIs. Once the same is available to Category –II FPIs, we believe, the volume momentum will pick up notably. Regulatory measures, such as interoperability of margins between stock exchanges and commodity exchanges, allowing partial withdrawal of SGF or determining clients' margin requirements on net positions, if implemented, have the potential to further boost volumes. Outlook We expect MCX to deliver an FY24-26 revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 28%/ 205%/157%, fueled by a 47% CAGR in options volumes.

Similarly, few would have been willing to bet their money onAdani Portsafter the pounding it look in January and February last year over the Hindenburg report. Here too the street is in for a surprise: Adani Ports figures at number three for consistency. Follow our market blog for live updates To test the consistency of performance of Nifty 50 stocks in FY24 we observed the monthly returns of Nifty 50 constituents and compared it with Nifty 50 returns.

However there are at least 16 Nifty stocks that gave positive returns on more occasions, reflecting better consistency in performance in FY24. And Adani Ports, Hero MotoCorp, andBajaj Autohave given the maximum positive returns among the 16 contesters. Better consistency also indicates momentum in the underlying security. Bajaj Auto gave positive returns in 11 months of the past 12 months and outperformed the index in 10 out of 12 months. The company’s newly launched Triumph has presence in Bangalore and Kerala and its market share has reached 20 percent in the category. It plans to grow its footprint beyond 100 cities, covering 50 percent of the market “We expect Bajaj Auto to benefit from market share gains over the long term, driven by the premiumization trend, an opportunity in exports, and a sizeable position in the scooter EV market,” said Amber Shukla and Ankit Desai of Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage firm further said that reduced inventory levels and higher enquiries from rural geographies with higher demand for 125+ cc vehicles gives management the confidence to beat average industry growth in FY25.

Morgan Stanley has estimated Brent crude at $90 a barrel this summer. The gains in OMC stocks despite such an outlook come on the back of favourable coverage by Nomura. The brokerage remains bullish on the prospects of the state-run refiners as it believes that the marketing overhang is now complete, while the refining outlook remains healthy. Analysts at Nomura are factoring in refining margins of $9 per barrel for FY25-26, indicating confidence in the sector's performance. The brokerage has upgraded Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) to 'buy' from 'neutral' earlier with a raised target price of Rs 570 and Rs 195. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action It also has a 'buy' rating on Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) with a raised target price of Rs 735, up from Rs 455 earlier. On the contrary, CLSA has a 'sell' call on all three leading OMCs. According to the foreign brokerage, Brent breakout at $88 per barrel is the breakeven point for marketing margins. Any additional increase in crude prices could potentially unsettle investors. There is concern regarding the possibility of marketing margins turning negative for Indian IOC, BPCL, and HPCL. Considering the upcoming general elections, it is unlikely that there will be a retail price hike, CLSA said, adding that the lack of pricing power of IOC, BPCL, and HPCL at high crude prices is expected to be exposed. As a result, CLSA maintains its sell call on IOC, BPCL, and HPCL. Rising crude prices may strain OMCs as they face higher costs in sourcing crude for refining into petrol and diesel. As crude oil prices surge, OMCs might find it challenging to fully pass on the cost hikes to consumers, given government regulations or market competition. The recent government decision to slash petrol and diesel prices by Rs 2 per litre, combined with escalating crude prices, could further squeeze OMCs' profit margins. Also Read |Oil prices ease on Gaza ceasefire possibility, dollar strength Motilal Oswal expects a negative stock price reaction for OMCs in the near term, given the retail price cut and recent elevated Brent crude prices. It has a 'buy' rating on HPCL and IOC and a 'neutral' rating on BPCL. As the impact of the Red Sea crisis on crude oil and refining GRMs wanes, the marketing margins can recover to above Rs 3 per litre again, the brokerage said. Macquarie is also bearish on OMC stocks. It has downgraded HPCL to 'neutral' from 'outperform' with a target price of Rs 425. IOC has also been downgraded to 'underperform' from 'neutral', with a target price of Rs 130.

During the day, Nifty has managed to hold on to the support zone of 21900 – 21850 where support parameters in the form the 40-day average and the previous swing low is placed. It is still trading in the range 21900 – 22200 since the last three trading sessions and a decisive breach shall lead to trending moves in that direction. So, until the support zone is held, we can expect the positive momentum to resume. In terms of levels, 22215 – 22250 is the immediate hurdle zone while 21900 – 21860 is the crucial support. Bank Nifty closed the day on a negative note for the seventh consecutive trading session. It has however recovered sharply from the intraday lows (46022). It has in the process held on to the 20-week average which is currently at 46300. We expect the Bank Nifty to recover, and, on the upside, it can rise to 47230 – 47400.

Taking Stock: Market inches closer to record high amid volatility; midcap index hits fresh high Broader indices outperformed with BSE midcap index (up 0.6 percent) hitting fresh record high and smallcap index rose 1 percent.... Read More Nifty traded in a narrow range with a negative bias to close flat at 22435 levels. Broader market outperformed with the Nifty midcap 100 up 0.4% and the Nifty Smallcap 100 up 1%. Sector-wise it was a mixed bag with PSU Bank being the top gainer. Markets are trading with caution ahead of the RBI policy meeting and key macro data to be released in the US and Europe. Also, US Fed Chair Powell's speech will be keenly watched. We expect the market to consolidate over the next few days until the events unfold. Market traded volatile for yet another session and ended on a flat note, tracking mixed cues. Weak global markets triggered a gap-down start however buying in select heavyweights pared losses in no time. Consequently, Nifty retested yesterday’s high also but failed to surpass the same and eventually closed at 22,434.65 levels. Meanwhile, the sectoral indices also traded mixed wherein IT and financial services edged higher while realty and FMCG closed in the red. Interestingly, the broader indices managed to continue their outperformance and gained in the range of 0.5%-1.2%. The prevailing resilience in the index amid weak global cues shows that bulls are in control and we expect the tone to strengthen above 22,550 levels in Nifty. Traders should align their positions accordingly, with a focus on stock selection. The Nifty opened gap down and witnessed a recovery during the day to close off the intraday lows though marginally in the red down ~19 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty has been witnessing consolidation since the past three trading sessions. the momentum setup on the daily and hourly tie frame is providing divergent signal and hence can lead to a consolidation in the near term. On the downside the zone of 22400 – 22350 is acting as a support zone while 22500 – 22530 is the immediate hurdle zone. A breach on the range on either side shall result in a trending move. Bank Nifty managed to close the day in the green. The zone of 47300 – 47250 acted as a crucial support zone and absorbed the selling pressure. We expect the Bank Nifty to continue with the up-move towards 48000 – 48160 over the next few trading sessions. The Bank Nifty index experienced buying pressure from lower levels and managed to sustain above the support zone of 47500-47400. However, it faces immediate resistance at 48000, and a decisive breakthrough could trigger further short-covering rallies towards the 49000 mark. It's anticipated to consolidate within the range of 47400-48000 leading up to the RBI policy announcement, with potential trending moves expected thereafter. There is a subtle positivity in the Indian market, bucking the weak global trend, aided by positive manufacturing PMI data and optimistic expectation of upcoming Q4 results. Buoyancy of the broad market indicates strength to continue in the short-term. Meanwhile, strong US economic data has apparently cast doubts on the Fed rate cut in June anticipated by the market. Market is focused on the US FED chair’s speech, later today, for more hints. A statement in-line with the last policy is predicted to bring back a respite to the global market. Nifty remained volatile throughout the day after an initial weak start attributed to negative global cues. Despite this, the overall sentiment remains robust as the index sustains itself above key moving averages. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates bullish momentum in the short term. Over the short term, the index may trend towards 22,650. Support is positioned at 22,350 on the lower end. SJVN, formerly known as Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Indian Institute of Technology Patna (IIT Patna) to use advanced geological models in SJVN's tunnelling projects, thus significantly reducing time and cost overruns. Weak Asian and US market cues coupled with caution ahead of the RBI's monetary policy announcement on Friday saw domestic equities end flattish with a negative bias. Surging crude oil prices and uptick in US bond yields are making investors nervous with FIIs offloading local shares further dampening the sentiment. By moving in tandem with the weak global peers, Indian equities commenced the day on a tepid note but a quick recovery was seen from the lower levels, and a follow-through rally helped the Index trim all its losses; however, towards the end of the day, the Index came off from highs and finally settled at 22,434.65 with a loss of 18.65 points. Among the sectors, PSU Banking was the top performer followed by IT and Media while profit booking pressure was observed in the Realty stocks. Buying traction remained in the Broader markets as Mid and Smallcaps gained further by 0.52% & 1.16% respectively. The Index is oscillating in the range of 22,350-22,500, breakout on either side will provide proper direction. Indian rupee ended marginally lower at 83.43 per dollar versus Tuesday's close of 83.38.

Read More Nifty opened gap up today and witnessed selling pressure during the second half of the trading session which resulted into a marginal negative close for the index. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty has faced resistance at the upper end of the channel placed around 22740 – 22770. The hourly momentum indicator has triggered a negative crossover which is sign of loss of momentum. Thus, we can expect some consolidation though the overall trend is still positive, and we expect the dips towards 22600 – 22580 to be bought into. Bank Nifty also witnessed selling pressure during the second half though it managed to close the day in the green. Overall, trend remains positive and dips towards support zone 48550 – 48500 should be used as a buying opportunity. Overall, the immediate upside / hurdle is placed at 49250 – 49300 Sensex & Nifty scaled new lifetime highs on the auspicious day of Gudi Padwa, but markets erased all its gains to end flat with a negative bias on select profit taking. While fundamentals continue to be strong, stretched valuations will allow investors to book profit at regular intervals. Investors would still be mindful of rising crude prices and US Fed’s inability to cut rates amid stubborn inflation, which could fuel uncertainty going ahead. The Indian market reached a fresh intraday peak before seeing profit-booking at higher levels in anticipation of tomorrow's key US inflation data, which carries weight in determining future rate cuts by the US Fed. Concerns have emerged amidst recent better-than-anticipated US employment and manufacturing data, suggesting a potential shift in expectations regarding rate cuts this year. Moreover, escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, alongside supply concerns, have propelled crude prices upward, impacting overall market sentiment. In the near term, the focus will shift to Q4 earnings, which will kick off this weekend. Nifty opened higher but struggled to withstand the selling pressure at elevated levels. On the hourly chart, the RSI (14) indicates bearish divergence, signaling a potential shift in price momentum towards the downside. Immediate support is observed at 22,600; a decisive drop below this level could drive the index towards 22,400. Conversely, resistance is evident at 22,770 on the higher end. Nifty50 began the day at another record level of 22,700 but failed to keep the strong momentum going and remained sideways in the morning trade. Profit booking in the 2nd half of the trading session pulled the Index lower to settle the day at 22,642.75 with a minuscule loss of 23.55 points. With gains of more than 1%, the metal sector was the star performer while the realty segment extended its journey towards the north, and on the flip side, Media and PSU Banks were added to the list of underperformers. Divergence was seen in the broader market performance where Smallcaps managed to end in the green while Midcaps marginally underperformed. On the daily timeframe, the Index has made a bearish candle. Still, the overall uptrend is intact and correction if any, will provide better opportunities to enter at the lower levels. A level of 22,530 offers strong support while immediate resistance is placed at 22,780. In the fourth quarter, the anticipated corporate earnings have been a driving force behind the recent market momentum. Despite notable increases in the prices of gold, crude oil, and metals, investors are witnessing an upward trend in equity markets, and there are expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Investors may consider locking in partial profits while keeping a hold approach. Government policies and reforms have played a crucial role in fostering a stable environment conducive to market growth. Measures aimed at stimulating the economy, coupled with a focus on digitalization and infrastructure development, have attracted substantial investments. The growing involvement of retail investors, combined with sustained interest from foreign institutional investors, highlights the widespread confidence in India's growth story.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/taking-stock-sensex-nifty-post-over-2-weekly-fall-steepest-in-20-weeks-12467341.html,"India's benchmark Sensex and Nifty faced their first weekly decline after four weeks of gains and posted around two percent loss during the week, the steepest weekly decline in 20 weeks. Broad-based selling and a meltdown in mid and smallcap stocks continued, alarming investors amidst regulatory warnings. The benchmark Sensex lost 2.2 percent during the week while Nifty fell 2.1 percent. This was the steepest weekly fall since October 2023. BSE MidCap and SmallCap lost around 4 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Weakness in global equities, driven by discouraging US data, reduced expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, further dampening sentiments. Separate reports on Thursday revealed that US producer prices exceeded forecasts in February, while fewer individuals applied for and received jobless benefits than anticipated, weakening the case for a rate cut by the Fed. BSE MidCap and SmallCap stocks have faced heavy selling since mid-February, following SEBI's directive to mutual funds to safeguard investors amidst concerns of overheating. Analysts anticipated the decline due to inflated valuations post-2023 bull run, with BSE SmallCap up 74 percent and MidCap index over 60 percent in the past year, raising caution. The ongoing market correction is seen as healthy, aiming to balance overbought zones, analysts said. The SEBI Chairperson recently announced mandatory disclosure for mutual funds focusing on stress testing by March 15. This aims to gauge how quickly funds can exit portfolios during stress. It addresses challenges faced during redemptions in illiquid markets. The disclosure informs investors about potential outcomes in small-cap and mid-cap funds during stress. AMFI also outlined stress test guidelines for small-cap and midcap schemes, directing fund houses to submit results every 15 days, with the first report due by March 15. These tests reveal portfolio liquidity, crucial for swift investor withdrawals during market collapses and increased redemptions. Outlook for March 18 Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities: Domestic equities followed global cues as weak US and Asian markets fuelled extended profit-taking with investors selling auto, oil & gas, banking and power stocks. The recent subdued economic readings related to inflation and IIP numbers too didn't help either, which further aggravated the bearish mood during the week. With uncertainty around, local investors will closely follow global markets to decide on their exposure to equities. Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research, Religare Broking: Markets traded lackluster amid mixed cues and lost over half a percent. After the initial downtick, the Nifty inched gradually lower and almost reached closer to Thursday’s low.  Though it tried to recoup losses in the latter half, pressure on select heavyweights capped the recovery. Eventually, it settled at 22,024 level; down by 0.53 percent. Most sectors traded in line with the move and settled in the red wherein auto, energy and pharma were among the top losers. Meanwhile, the broader indices traded mixed and that resulted in neutral market breadth. Indications are in favor of consolidation with negative bias until the Nifty decisively reclaims 22,250 levels. However, the pace of decline would remain gradual citing the resilience of select heavyweights across sectors. Traders should continue with a stock-specific approach and maintain positions on both sides. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities: In the last week, the benchmark indices witnessed profit booking at higher levels, after a sharp decline the Nifty ended 2.20 percent lower while the Sensex shed over 1600 points. Among Sectors, the majority of sectoral indices witnessed profit booking at higher levels Reality and Media indices lost the most, shed nearly 9 percent. Technically, on weekly charts the index has formed a long bearish candle and it is also trading below the 20 day SMA (Simple Moving Average) which is largely negative. We are of the view that, as long as the index is trading below 20 day SMA or 22200/73200 the weak formation is likely to continue. Below the same, the market could slip till 21800-21700/72000-71700. On the flip side, for the bulls 22150/73000 and 22200/73200- or 20-day SMA would be the key resistance areas. Fresh uptrend rally possible only after dismissal of 20 day SMA or 73200. Above the same, it could retest the level of 22300-22350/73500-73700 For Bank Nifty, 50 day SMA or 46500 would act as a sacrosanct zone, above the same, it could move up till 47200-47500. On the other side, below 50 day SMA uptrend would be vulnerable. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities: The Nifty has once again closed below the rising trendline, bringing market sentiment back into a state of weakness. The momentum indicator suggests bearish momentum in the near term. Immediate support is situated at the 50DMA, currently at 21,900, which is expected to provide support for the Nifty. A decisive drop below 21,900 could lead to a sharp decline in the index. On the upside, resistance is observed in the range of 22,200-22,250.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/gold-beans-all-the-rage-with-chinas-gen-z-as-deflation-bites-12470261.html,"With China’s deflation at its worst in 15 years, a volatile stock market and bank interest rates too low for her liking, 18-year-old Tina Hong is placing her financial security in gold beans. Weighing as little as one gram, the beans — and other forms of gold jewelry — are increasingly viewed as the safest investment bet for young Chinese in an era of economic uncertainty. It’s part of a larger consumer trend for all things gold — from bullion to beans and bracelets — that has gripped the mainland. “It’s basically impossible to lose money from buying gold,” reasoned Hong, a college freshman studying computer science in Fujian province who in January began buying gold beans because of their relatively low cost of about 600 yuan ($83) per gram. She has more than two grams of the beans and will continue buying them as long as costs are lower than international gold prices, she said. Branded as an investment entry point for young consumers, the beans, which come in glass jars, are the latest hot-selling items in Chinese jewelry stores. Generation Z consumers — buffeted by high youth unemployment and the nation’s slide into deflation — are now among the top consumers of gold accessories in the world’s second-largest economy, according to the 2023 China Jewelry Consumer Trends Report by Chow Tai Fook Jewelery Group Ltd. The attraction of gold comes as people pull back on shopping amid months of disappointing growth. China Gold Rush A lack of faith in traditional investments has fueled this new China gold rush. The nation’s stock market has seen declines after reopening from the pandemic, with one of its key benchmarks dropping to levels last seen in 2018. The country’s middle class is bearing the brunt of a property downturn — while the central bank has lowered a key interest rate four times since December 2021, eating into the return on wealth management products. Young people are skipping “pleasurable consumption” and instead purchasing “asset-style jewelry” such as gold beans for adornment and investments, said Nikos Kavalis, managing director at the London-based consultancy Metals Focus Ltd. However, he cautions that it makes no sense to invest in gold beans — or other gold items — because their price is often 10% to 30% higher than the commodity’s spot price. Investors would be better served by parking money in gold ETFs, he said. Still, the fascination with gold is sweeping across social media. On Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of X, formerly Twitter, the hashtag “Why Are Young People Getting into Buying Gold” garnered 91 million hits. A lively discussion about the enduring value of gold dominates the social media site, with one popular post stating that “buying gold keeps troubles at bay.” Three-quarters of gold consumers are now estimated to be between 25 and 35 years old and many believe investing in gold is low-risk, according to a 2021 report from the World Gold Council. That belief is reinforced as gold prices have hit multiple historic highs since December. Gold bullion passed the $2,100 per ounce threshold for the first time this month. Sales of gold, silver and jewelery reached a six-year high in December, a 29.4% year-on-year jump, according to government data. Precious metals now represent one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in China. Buying gold beans for gifting and investments also reached a peak during China’s lunar new year, says a spokesperson from Chinese jeweler Luk Fook Holdings International Ltd. Even banks have joined traditional gold retailers to sell gold beans. China Merchants Bank Co., for example, introduced its line of gold bean sets in July 2023. “Despite the recent surge in China’s gold price, consumers are still demonstrating a strong preference for gold,” said Cindy Yeung, chairwoman and managing director of Emperor Watch & Jewellery Ltd. Like other major jewelry retailers, Emperor is talking up gold on social media and e-commerce platforms. Impure Beans There are perils for consumers of gold beans and other gold objects who aren’t knowledgeable about the difference between authentic gold and fakes, experts say. Lily Chen, a 26-year-old Shanghai office worker, discovered almost all of the gold beans she had purchased were mixed with iron, zinc and copper when she recently tried to exchange them for a gold bracelet. “I never tried cutting corners by buying gold at ultra-cheap prices, and I made sure to buy from star-rated web stores. But this could still happen,” she said.

The brokerage firm anticipates margins for QSR companies to stay under pressure in Q4FY24, weighed down partly by weak demand, and the cost of store additions.The Kotak note estimates a decline in Same Store Sales for Jubilant Foodworks,Westlife Foodworld, Devyani International, Sapphire Foods, andRestaurant Brands Asiain the range of 2.5-15 percent in Q4FY24. The brokerage also slashed its FY25-26 EBITDA estimates for the sector by 3-12 percent citing continued weakness in the first half of FY25, with prospects of recovery only coming into play from the second half of the year. Same Store Salesis a metric to gauge retail and QSR companies, and measures the amount of sales in the stores that have been operating for a year or more. Kotak believes the QSR slowdown has turned out to be more prolonged than what was initially anticipated. Same store sales growth too is likely to stay subdued in Q4FY24, largely due to an early Ramdan which affected 20 days of business in the quarter as against 10 days in the year-ago period.

Though the Kotak Institutional note finds it difficult to predict a recovery, it believes the QSR industry could be toward the end of its downcycle. The note choseSapphire Foodsas its preferred pick within the QSR space citing reasonable valuations and lower risk to earnings, followed byDevyani International.

Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: Punjab National Bank In the previous session, Punjab National Bank showed significant rise. On the below chart, we can see that prices finally gave breakout of the consolidation as it has given a close above Rs 132 levels. Recently Parabolic SAR (stop and reverse) dots have started to form below the price which keeps short term bias on the positive side. Along with this, MACD (moving average convergence and divergence) has shown a bullish crossover which is acting as a double confirmation. In short, overall tone for Punjab National Bank is bullish. Use dips towards Rs 133 as a buying opportunity with a target of Rs 139. While on the downside, Rs 131 is the nearest support level. Escorts Kubota More than double the average volume suggests that buying pressure has increased. In the previous session, prices gave close above previous swing high. Also, prices have given breakout of the downward sloping trendline which indicates strength. For now, with follow up buying we can expect more rise in this stock. In short, trend for Escorts is bullish. A break above Rs 3,020 can lift the price higher towards Rs 3,150 as long as Rs 2,880 holds on the downside. L&T Technology Services LTTS maintained its solid uptrend and kept moving higher. Price has closed above Rs 5,680 level which confirmed breakout of the rounding bottom pattern. Recently prices gave breakout of the Ichimoku cloud which is a positive sign. Also, since past 8 trading sessions not a single candle has given a close below previous day’s low which suggests strength in the ongoing trend. In short, trend for this stock is positive.

NSE to launch four new indices in capital markets, F&O segments from April 8 The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has on April 3 announced the launch of four new indices effective from April 8, in both the capital markets and Futures & Options segments. These four new indices are Nifty Tata Group 25 percent Cap, Nifty 500 Multicap India Manufacturing 50:30:20, Nifty 500 Multicap Infrastructure 50:30:20, and Nifty MidSmall Healthcare. “Consequently, the broadcast of the indices will be made available to F&O members in NEAT+ terminals under the multiple index inquiry screen,” NSE said in a circular. Dollar The dollar index held near its highest level in over four months on Wednesday, pinning the yen close to its lowest its decades, though the increased threat of currency intervention by Tokyo capped further declines in the Japanese currency. The Japanese yen was last at 151.8 per dollar, little recovered from last week's slump to 34-year lows of 151.975, as the Bank of Japan's historic policy shift only served to underscore its outlier status. Gold Prices Gold prices hit a fresh record high for the fourth straight session on Wednesday, as a cocktail of factors from growing tensions in the Middle East, US interest rate cut expectations and sticky inflation has boosted bullion's allure. Crude Oil prices extended gains on Wednesday, as investors mulled supply risks stemming from Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries and the potential for escalation in the Middle East conflict, while OPEC+ ministers held steady their output policy. FII and DII data Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) net sold shares worth Rs 2,213.56 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased Rs 1,102.41 crore worth of stocks on April 3, provisional data from the NSE showed.

On April 8, the company signed a share-purchase agreement with Ismartu, a Noida-based company that makes, assembles, sells, distributes, imports and exports mobile phones and other electronics. WhileDixon Technologies'acquisition of Ismartu, which is the manufacturing arm of Transsion Holdings, at an attractive valuation will help it further expand in the domestic smartphone market, Kotak Institutional Equities has reiterated its “sell” call on the stock with a price target of Rs 5,200. The price target is higher than the previous time but still implies a 32 percent downside from the current levels. This is because the brokerage valuations are expensive and the target price already factors in the company's electronics manufacturing services segment (EMS), components and exports, the Kotak report said. ""We lower our FY24 earnings estimate by 8 percent and raise our FY25 and FY26 estimates by 9 and 6 percent, respectively, owing to an expected ramp-up in the mobile segment, driven by the Ismartu acquisition,"" Kotak analysts said.

Its plan to collaborate with local contract manufacturers reflects a strategic move to bolster domestic manufacturing capabilities. Should this collaboration materialise, Dixon stands to gain from increased volumes, potentially leading to a broader market share in the domestic mobile manufacturing sector. The partnership presents promising avenues for growth and expansion for Dixon, Kotak said in the note. In the third quarter, the company's consumer electronics and home appliance business clocked modest revenue growth because of competitive intensity.

In the coming week, the US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, macro-data, and more stress test results from mutual fund houses are expected to keep markets on tenterhooks, said analysts, advising investors to buy-on-every dip. Frontline indices Sensex and Nifty declined 2 percent each last week, while broader markets - the BSE Smallcap and the BSE Midcap - slipped up to 6 percent. All the sectors traded in the red, except IT and Consumer goods, with maximum fall seen in Oil & Gas, Construction, and Media. In the coming week, the market is expected react to the US Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan's interest rate decisions. Other than that, important macro-economic data of major countries and S&P Global manufacturing and services PMIs of India, UK, and the US will also be watched out for. ""The week ahead, the global central bank’s monetary policy decision will get investor attention. The US Fed, Bank of Japan, and Bank of England will unveil their rate decisions. There is uncertainty over Fed rate cuts due to an increase in the US unemployment rate and higher-than-expected US inflation. Consequently, the US 10-year yield and dollar index inched higher, and the repercussions were visible in the emerging markets as well,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. Here are the top 10 factors that will garner a market reaction: 1. US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision The US Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rate unchanged in the range of 5.25-5.5 percent, according to economists' predictions. Other than this, market participants will keenly track economic projections and interest rate cut forecast. According to aReuterspoll, economists predicted the US Fed to start cutting interest rates in June 2024 as the central bank awaits more data to confirm whether inflation is heading convincingly towards the 2 percent target. In February, the US consumer price index rose to 3.2 percent, slightly above market expectations of 3.1 percent. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, increased 0.4 percent from the last month and 3.8 percent from a year ago. The movement in US bond yields and dollar index post US Fed's interest rate decision will also influence equity trends. On March 15, the US 10-year bond yield stood around 4.3 percent, while the US dollar index hovered around the 103 level. Global factors Apart from this, the Bank of Japan and Bank of England will also announce their monetary policy decisions. Additionally, investors will track the UK producer price index and the S&P Global Manufacturing & Services PMI.  Domestic factors Back home, India's Services PMI data will also be released. Additionally, market participants will watch out for the bank loan and deposit growth as it will determine the sector's performance going ahead. India will also release its foreign exchange reserves data. Stress test results Several mutual fund houses released their liquidity stress test results following Sebi's mandate to Association of Mutual Funds India (AMFI). The move comes on the back of market regulator SEBI’s concern over froth in these schemes amid relentless flow despite large fund houses restricting inflows due to lack of investment opportunity at the right valuation. Nippon India Small Cap Fund, which runs the biggest small-cap scheme with Rs 46,000 crore worth of assets under management (AUM), said it will need 27 days to sell off half of its portfolio. Edelweiss Mutual Fund said it would take two days to liquidate 50 percent of the portfolio. All these mutual fund houses need to publish their stress test results every 15 days beginning March 15. IPO & listing After weeks of back-to-back IPOs, primary markets will see some calm this week. Mainboard IPO Krystal Integrated Services will close its subscription on March 18. On the second day of bidding, the IPO was subscribed by 70 percent. The company will debut exchanges on March 21, 2024. Apart from that, SME IPO Vishwas Agri Seeds will open for subscription on March 21 and close on March 26. Vishwas Agri Seeds operates within the agricultural sector, specialising in the processing and distribution of seeds to farmers through an extensive network. The company offers a diverse range of crop seeds, including Groundnut, Soybean, Wheat, Cumin, Green Gram, and Black Gram. FII flow Market participants will watch out for foreign flows this week following Sebi's approval of a raft of relaxations for foreign portfolio investors, alternative investment funds, and entities seeking to raise funds through initial share sales, as part of facilitating the ease of doing business in the securities market. So far in March, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) bought equities worth Rs 40,710 crore. On March 15, FIIs bought Rs 848 crore worth of equities, while DIIs sold Rs 682 crore worth of equities. Technical View Analysts expect markets to experience further downward pressure in the coming week after the break of dual support, that is, 20-DEMA and rising trendline on the daily chart. ""A breakdown below the previous swing low i.e. 21,850 could result in the next leg of down move to 21,500. The view would be negated if it manages to cross and hold decisively above the 22,250 level. Among the key sectors, IT and FMCG look comparatively stronger while others may continue to trade mixed. Amid all, we reiterate our preference for index majors and suggest maintaining positions on both sides,"" said Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice-President of Technical Research at Religare Broking. Oil Prices Brent crude futures, the international oil benchmark, finally closed above the key hurdle, i.e. $84 a barrel, after several weeks of consolidation. In fact, the price has seen a breakout of downward sloping resistance trendline, though the volume was lower than average. Brent crude futures closed at $85.34 a barrel, up 4 percent on weekly basis. Brent may face the next resistance at $88 a barrel, with support at around $80 a barrel, experts said. Oil prices have reacted positively to the bullish demand outlook for crude oil in 2024 from the leading energy research houses (OPEC, EIA and IEA) and further hinting of supply deficit of 0.3-0.5 mbpd during the course of the year. Hence, ""we see oil prices head for further upside in short to medium term. All the major correction should be considered as buying opportunities,"" Mohammed Imran, research analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said. F&O Cues and India VIX Considering the volatile trade with negative bias, the options data indicated that 21,800 is expected to be key support for the Nifty 50 in the coming days, with crucial hurdle on the higher side at 22,300. On the weekly options front, the maximum Call open interest was seen at 23,000 strike, followed by 22,500 strike and 22,000 strike, with meaningful Call writing at 22,000 strike, then 22,100 & 22,300 strikes, while on the Put side, the 21,000 strike owned the maximum open interest, followed by 22,000 & 21,800 strikes, with writing at 21,000 strike, then 21,800 strike. The volatility increased a bit after a sharp fall in the previous week, but remained below the 14 mark on the weekly basis, hence it is not worrisome for bulls. India VIX, the fear gauge, rose 0.57 percent to 13.69 from 13.61 levels. If the VIX spikes above the 16 mark, then bulls may turn uncomfortable, experts said.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/psu-bank-stocks-jump-bofa-bullish-on-canara-bank-union-bank-and-boi-12554791.html,"PSU Bank stocks rallied on April 1, pushing the Nifty PSU index up by over a percent. The current benign credit environment has supported asset quality of these banks, helping the stocks to rise, analysts said. Bank of America (BoFA) Securities is bullish on smaller PSU banks, citing better risk-reward on higher earnings growth and valuation upside. According to BofA Securities, consensus estimates for FY25 remain conservative for PSU banks, suggesting potential for EPS upgrades ranging from 10 to 20 percent, driven by increased confidence in the consistency of earnings per share and Return on Assets (RoA) delivery, coupled with a rise in foreign ownership. Other state-run lenders are still one to two years behind in their earnings recovery cycle, positioning them to drive positive surprises in financial year 2025 and 2026, it said. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Foreign ownership in other state-run lenders is still half of State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of Baroda (BoB) and the brokerage expects the gap to narrow. The PSU Bank index has risen 96 percent in the past year and stocks such asCanara Bankand Union Bank of India soared over 100 percent during the period. Bank of India shares have risen 80 percent. The international brokerage has a “buy” call on smaller PSUs such asUnion Bank, Canara Bank andBank of India, with a target price of Rs 180, Rs 600 and Rs 170, respectively. For SBI and BoB, however, the brokerage has a “neutral” rating as earnings expectations for both lenders are already quite optimistic, which doesn’t leave much lower room for positive surprises, the brokerage said.

The deputy vice-president and head of the technical and derivative research desk at SBI Securities believes that the Nifty IT index will test the 38,500 level in the short term. Seasoned for more than 15 years in technical and derivatives research, Shah estimates that the 21,900 - 21,850 zone will be crucial support for the Nifty 50. Sustaining below 21,850 will lead to an extension of the correction up to 21,500 in the short term, he said. Here's the excerpts from an interaction on the market withMoneycontrol: Do you think the Nifty has entered the consolidation mode with support at 21,860 or there is a possibility of another round of correction up to 21,500 in the coming sessions? Last week, ended March 15, after a rising channel breakdown in the Nifty on the daily scale, the index has taken support around 21,900-21,930 zone as it is the confluence of 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) and the prior swing low. Apart from Nifty index trading below its 20-day EMA level, the 20-day EMA has started edging lower. The charts of large-cap stocks display a mixed picture in addition to some weakness being observed in the momentum indicators and oscillators for the Nifty. Hence, we feel that these factors are hinting at a possible consolidation for the Nifty in the near term. The 21,900 - 21,850 zone will be a crucial support for the index. Sustaining below 21,850 will lead to an extension of the correction up to 21,500 levels in the short term. On the upside, the zone of 22,200-22,250 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index. Sustaining above the 22,250 level, the index would resume its journey up to 22,530-22,700. Stocks that look structurally strong, especially after the recent steep fall... Based on relative strength charts, large-caps such as Ambuja Cements, Bharti Airtel, Cipla, Colpal, HDFC AMC, Nestle India and TCS look structurally strong with promising signs of outperformance, while Persistent Systems, Dixon Technologies and L&T Technology Services look strong from the mid-cap space. Also read:What should you do with your mid and small-cap holdings amid heightened volatility? Experts weigh in Do you think the worst is over for midcap and smallcap indices? After the fierce sell-off in the first half of the week ended March 15, the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices have seen minor pullback in the last two trading sessions. But the worst is not over. We feel underperformance in these indices when compared to Nifty would continue. One needs to be extremely stock-specific and choose the stocks wisely, which are structurally strong on charts backed by strong fundaments. For the Midcap index, we feel that the 100-day EMA zone of 45,300-45,500 could act as an important support, while 47,400-47,500 zone would act as a potential resistance on the upside. The Nifty Smallcap index is relatively weaker than Midcap index. While the Midcap index is 6 percent down from its all-time high, the Smallcap barometer has corrected over 12 percent from its highs. We expect the index to consolidate negatively between 20 DEMA zone of 15,300 on the upside and 13,900 on the downside. Also read:Keep your portfolio in green even when market turns red: Here's a blueprint from experts Does the private bank index look better than the PSU bank index? Looking at the ratio chart of Nifty Private Bank index to Nifty PSU Bank index, clear signs of outperformance by private banks are visible since past few trading sessions. Tracking the levels, the Nifty Private Bank index has key supports placed at 22,800-23,000 zone, which is the 200-day EMA Level as well as the upward sloping trendline zone. The charts of heavyweight stocks such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank in the Nifty Private Banks index show promising signs. PSU Bank Index, which has breached its recent swing low, needs to cross and sustain above its 10-20 EMA zone of 6,950-7,000 zone for it to witness a resurgence in momentum on the upside. Which sector is entering in decisive breakout? We anticipate that Nifty IT will show strong performance in the short term as it has rebounded from an important support zone of 36,600, which is 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of recent swing up move from 30,054 to 38,559. Additionally, during the recent downturn in frontline indices, Nifty IT has exhibited higher relative strength with the ratio chart of Nifty IT to Nifty forming a sequence of higher highs and higher lows since last five trading sessions indicating its potential for outperformance in the current market conditions. We believe, it is likely to test the level of 38,500 in short-term. Your top two bets for the next week... L&T Technology Services On Friday, the stock has given Falling Wedge pattern breakout on daily scale backed by robust volume. The stock is currently trading above its short and long-term moving averages. The momentum indicators and oscillators are also supporting the overall bullish chart structure. We recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 5,360-5,400 level with stop-loss at Rs 5,190 for a target of Rs 5,700, followed by Rs 5,850 in short-term. Cochin Shipyard The stock has rebounded from Rs 720 levels, which is 100-day EMA level as well as 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of its prior upward move (Rs 430-941). While reclaiming its 20 & 50-day EMA levels, the rebound is also backed by volumes above 50-day average. The daily RSI (relative strength index) has also given bullish crossover. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 890-880 with stop-loss of Rs 850 for a target of Rs 940, followed by Rs 960 in short-term.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/goldman-sachs-raises-reliance-industries-stock-target-price-with-buy-rating-sees-54-upside-12528131.html,"Reliance Industries shares jumped over 3 percent on March 27 after Goldman Sachs reiterated a ‘buy’ rating on Reliance Industries Ltd, with as much as a 54 percent upside by FY26 in its bull case, citing favourable risk-reward dynamics, value unlocking from its Disney joint venture, and enhanced return on capital investments. With the capex cycle in two capital-intensive businesses, retail and Jio Telecom, reaching its peak, RIL will now start seeing improvements in its overall performance, said Goldman Sachs analysts. The brokerage raised the target price on theRILstock to Rs 4,495 in the bull case and Rs 3,400 in the base case, implying a 17 percent return from the previous closing price. Reliance Industries shares tend to outperform the Indian market under two conditions: expanding returns and valuation discovery through stake sales in newer businesses, the brokerage said. “Over the last two years, both these drivers were largely absent, potentially driving the shares’ underperformance. We expect rising returns ahead, which could compound with further potential value unlock through potential listings of consumer businesses,” the note said. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action RIL returns at inflection point Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that RIL’s consolidated returns are at an inflection point in FY24, and its Cash Return on Cash Invested (CROCI) will expand by nearly 270 basis points to 12 percent in FY27, which will be the highest since 2011. The brokerage noted that RIL is coming out of a series of long and intensive capex cycles. Reliance Industries has invested over $125 billion in capex over the last decade, mostly in hydrocarbon and telecom, which are more capex-intensive and have a longer gestation period of over five years. The businesses RIL is investing more in over the next three years are relatively less capex heavy, higher in returns, and have a shorter gestation period, it said. RIL earnings profile to grow stronger Goldman Sachs expects Reliance Retail’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to nearly double during FY24-27, with the share of consolidated EBITDA increasing to 14.3 percent in FY27 from 12.4 percent in FY23. For the new energy vertical, the brokerage expects positive EBITDA contribution to begin from FY25 and reach $2.3 billion by FY30. On a consolidated basis, analysts at Goldman Sachs expect RIL’s free cash flow, which has largely remained negative due to the elevated capex, to turn positive in FY25 with capex likely peaking out, while EBITDA may expand by 20 percent on-year, led by a telecom tariff hike, higher retail same-store sales growth and a recovery in chemical margins. A 17 percent annual increase in EBITDA between FY24 and FY27 is expected, driven by Retail EBITDA nearly doubling during this period, and a 22 percent annual EBITDA growth in the telecom business, driven by higher telecom ARPU. The continued shift of consumers to smartphones, robust growth in fixed broadband, recovery in petrochemical margins, driven by global demand and lower feedstock prices, along with sustained strength in diesel cracks due to limited global spare capacity, coupled with operational expenditure reduction, will also support high double-digit EBITDA growth, the analysts said. So far this year, RIL shares have rallied 11.5 percent, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50, which has risen a little over 1 percent during this period.

Immediate resistance for the index is at 47000, coinciding with the 20-day moving average (20DMA). A decisive break above the level can take the index towards the 47,500 mark, he said.

Overall momentum is increasing, as the ADX (average directional index) is at 29, indicating a trending market. In addition, prices recently closed above the previous swing high, which was near Rs 4,200 levels. Along with this, increase in volumes acting as a double confirmation. The stock has potential to move upside from current levels. However, for the better risk reward it would be wiser to use buy on dips approach. In short, Eicher Motors looks bullish.

Exide Industries On the daily chart, the stock has given a close above its important resistance of Rs 354 levels which is a positive sign. In the previous session, prices made a new lifetime high at Rs 383.5 levels. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands have also started expanding giving us hints of possible up move in coming sessions. While the RSI (relative strength index) is trading at an overbought zone so chances of profit booking cannot be ruled out. One can use this as a buying opportunity to ride the trend. In short, the overall technical outlook for Exide Industries is bullish. After a sharp rise, buy on dips will be a prudent strategy for better risk reward with the target of Rs 390 as long as Rs 363 holds on the downside. Follow Ashish Kyal on Twitter - @kyalashish

On the contrary, Bharti Airtel’s active market share increased by 30 basis points (bps) to 36.3 percent. However, Vodafone Idea lost its active market share by 20 bps MoM to 18.6 percent. ALSO READ:Jio cements market lead with 41.8 lakh mobile subscriber addition in January: TRAI data Overall, the telecom industry’s gross subscriber addition was healthy at 23 lakh in January, led by Jio and Bharti. The industry’s rural subscriber base grew by 17 lakh MoM, as against 16 lakh in December. On the mobile broadband front, Bharti Airtel gained its fair share of net adds at 24 lakh in January 2024, while Vodafone Idea lost 5 lakh subscribers in January 2024. On the other hand, India’s fixed broadband (FBB) subscribers have more than doubled over the past four years. JioFiber FBB’s net additions accelerated to 2.5 lakh (36 percent year-on-year (YoY), slightly higher than the 2.3 lakh monthly average in FYTD2024). Bharti Airtel added 1.1 lakh subscribers. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities believe that R-Jio and Bharti continued to gain wireless user market share at Vodafone Idea’s expense. “In our base case (status quo on Vodafone Idea or Vi, moderate tariff hikes), despite a likely fundraising for Vi, we expect market share gains for Bharti and R-Jio to continue at Vi’s expense, especially among premium subscribers, driven by pan-India 5G rollouts, and network coverage gap on 4G,” they said.

Analysts remain confident about the market undertone, but advise investors to avoid aggressive positions in the near term. The Sensex was down 240.66 points, or 0.32 percent, at 73,986.97, and the Nifty was down 78.20 points, or 0.35 percent, at 22,436.50. The market breadth was in favour of gainers, as around 1,496 shares advanced, 1,020 declined and 116 were unchanged. Follow our live blog for all the market action Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities, expects RBI's policy decision to be a non-event for markets, as the central bank is likely to keep interest rates unchanged for the seventh consecutive time. ""Most bankers and economists expect a status quo in key rates, and the majority of them expect the MPC to retain its policy stance of withdrawal of accommodation,"" he said. Tracking muted global cues, Jasani expects the Nifty to remain in the 22,453-22,619 band for the near term. Amidst market weakness, V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services believe that banking stocks provide opportunities to buy.

Taking Stock: Nifty hits fresh record high, Sensex up 354 pts; eyes on FOMC minutes, US CPI Except pharma, all other sectoral indices ended in the green with media, PSU Bank, FMCG, metal, oil & gas stocks were up 1-2 percent.... Read More The Indian rupee remained relatively stable, recording minor gains of 0.02 at 83.22. This sideways trend persisted, with the dollar index awaiting fresh triggers from the upcoming US CPI numbers scheduled for Wednesday evening. The strength of the Indian economy is expected to support the rupee, while global geopolitical tensions may exert pressure. Rupee's support levels are anticipated at 83.45-83.55, with resistance levels at 83.15-83.20. Markets edged higher and gained nearly half a percent, in continuation of the prevailing trend. After the initial gap-up move, Nifty remained range bound for most of the session and finally settled at 22,753.80 levels. Meanwhile, the majority of sectors were aligned with the move wherein FMCG, metal and energy were among the top gainers. The broader indices also edged higher after two days of pause and gained in the range of 0.7%-0.9%. The rotational buying across sectors combined with stability at the global front is helping the index to inch higher with every passing day. We are eyeing the 22,850-23,100 zone in Nifty ahead and expect the 22,350-22,500 zone would act as a strong support in case of any profit taking. The beginning of the earnings season would trigger stock-specific volatility ahead, so participants should plan their positions accordingly. On April 10, Indian benchmark indices concluded on a positive note, with the Nifty reaching a fresh record high. At the close, the Sensex surged by 354.45 points or 0.47 percent, settling at 75,038.15, while the Nifty climbed by 111.00 points or 0.49 percent, reaching 22,753.80. The Nifty commenced the session with a gap up opening and steadily advanced throughout the day, ultimately securing gains of approximately 111 points. Notably, it concluded above the previous swing high of 22,768.4, indicating a bullish sentiment. Both the daily and hourly momentum indicators exhibited a positive crossover, signaling a buy opportunity. Additionally, the daily Bollinger bands displayed an expansion, suggesting increased range, and with prices trending along the upper band, the possibility of sustained upward movement in the forthcoming trading sessions is implied. Regarding resistance levels, the immediate hurdle stands at 22,800, with further potential upside momentum likely towards 23,000. On the downside, support is observed at 22,650 – 22,600. Analyzing the Open Interest (OI) data, the call side exhibits the highest OI at 23,000, followed by the 22,900 strike prices, serving as robust resistance levels for the Nifty. Conversely, the highest OI on the put side is observed at the 22,700 strike price, indicating a support level. This data suggests a sideways movement scenario for the Nifty. Following the GIFT Nifty indication, Indian bourses commenced the day on a firm note around 22,700, and remained range bound till the afternoon session. A sharp uptick in the Banking and FMCG counters pushed the Index higher to settle the weekly expiry day at a record closing of 22,753.80 with gains of 111.05 points. Apart from Banking, Metal stocks contributed the most to the Index rally, and on the flip side, Pharma and Auto were the losers in today's trade. With gains of 0.97% & 0.73%, Mid and Small Caps outperform the Nifty50. The overall chart set-up of Nifty50 is strong and indicates an extension of the current up move to achieve a psychological target of 23,000 with the downside being protected at 22,530. The Nifty mostly remained sideways today as investors preferred to wait ahead of the US CPI inflation data, which could potentially impact rate cuts by the Fed. The resistance zone is placed at 22,700-22,750, while support is at 22,600. A decisive move above 22,750 might induce a rally towards 23,000 in the short term. Since the market appears to be range-bound, buying on dips and selling on rallies might prove to be a good strategy with proper stop-loss measures. Fitch cut its outlook on China's sovereign credit rating to negative on Wednesday, citing risks to public finances as the economy faces increasing uncertainty in its shift to new growth models. The outlook downgrade follows a similar move by Moody's in December and comes as Beijing ratchets up efforts to spur a feeble post-COVID recovery in the world's second-largest economy with fiscal and monetary support. The Bank Nifty index remained in consolidation mode at elevated levels, struggling to close above the 49,000 mark. Immediate support rests at 48,500, with resistance at 49,000. Any decisive move beyond these levels is expected to trigger trending moves. The index maintains a buy-on-dip stance, with 48,500 acting as a crucial support level to cushion against any downturns. Indian markets sustained their upward momentum, buoyed by a robust performance in the broader market, albeit slightly lagging behind its Asian and European counterparts. Investor attention remains fixated on the impending release of the FOMC minutes and US inflation data later today. Following the release of strong US job data, market sentiments are inclined towards an anticipation of spike inflation, thereby reducing the likelihood of a near-term rate cut. Additionally, Fitch's recent downgrade of China's credit rating could potentially reverberate through the global economy, warranting a caution. Indian rupee ended 12 paise higher at 83.19 per dollar on Wednesday versus Monday's close of 83.31. : Indian benchmark indices ended higher on April 10 with Nifty hitting fresh record high.

Nuvama expects Eicher Motors' revenue growth will be bolstered by improved volume and realisation. The expansion of EBITDA margin is anticipated due to enhanced net pricing and product mix. Robust growth in profit after tax (PAT) is likely, driven by a higher share of profits from the commercial vehicle subsidiary (VECV).

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/grasims-discount-pricing-for-birla-opus-may-be-code-red-for-rival-asian-paints-12513041.html,"Grasim's recently launched paint brand Birla Opus unveiled its dealer pricing which happens to sit at a discount of around 5 percent for most products to industry leader Asian Paints. Factoring in promotion volumes, brokerage firm Jefferies noted that the total gap appears to be broadly 10-15 percent across segments except in luxury, where the prices are broadly similar to the market leader. With the discounted offering from Grasim, Jefferies sees the battle intensifying in the Indian paints sector, which also poses a downside risk to market leader Asian Paints. Accordingly, Jefferies expects Asian Paints' earnings-per-stock to remain flattish over the next two years due to a rise in competition and sees downside risk to its already below consensus' forecasts. Jefferies has an 'underperform' call onAsian Paintswith a price target of Rs 2,500, which reflects a downside potential of over 12 percent from the previous close. On the other hand, the firm assigned a 'buy' call forGrasim, with a price target of Rs 2,600 which factors in the scope of around 17 percent upside in the stock. Also Read |As Grasim gears up to launch Birla Opus, Jefferies turns bearish on Asian Paints Well prepared Meanwhile, Jefferies also believes that Grasim has entered the paints segment with full preparation across all fronts.

""The company has even made claims of 98 percent product superiority over competition per blind tests,"" Jefferies noted. The company's entry in the paints industry will also increase the sector's capacity by 40 percent by FY25 and also offers a potential to further add 500 million litres in the medium term. The brokerage also believes that the use of latest technology and automation should show up in lower costs for Grasim along with high backward integration. Grasim also aims to set up a pan-India distribution by July 2024 and onboard 50,000 dealers by March 2025 to develop the second largest network in the paints sector.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/agri-picks-report-april-08-2024-geojit-12595231.html,"Geojit's report on Daily Agri Picks The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Food Price Index was at 118.3 points in March, up 1.1% from the revised level for February, the agency said in a report. The index was down 9.9 points or 7.7% from a year ago. ""Increases in the price indices for vegetable oils, dairy products, and meat have slightly more than offset a decrease in those for sugar and cereals,"" FAO said. The cereal price index fell 2.6% on month and 20% on year to 110.8 points in March. The decline can be attributed to a drop in global wheat prices for the third consecutive month in March, primarily due to strong competition among European Union countries, Russia, and the US in terms of exports. Ample supplies from Australia and the US amid cancelled wheat purchases by China, also contributed to the decline in prices, the report said. Maize export prices edged marginally upwards on month due to more buying by China. ""Logistical difficulties in Ukraine and elsewhere also provided some support to maize prices, although it was countered by seasonal pressure in Argentina and Brazil where harvests are underway,"" the report said. Global prices of barley fell, while those of sorghum increased in March. The FAO All Rice Price Index declined 1.7% in March, largely reflecting subdued global import demand, it said. The vegetable oil price index was up 8% month-onmonth at 130.6 points in March, at a one-year-high. ""The marked rebound reflected higher price quotations across palm, soy, sunflower and rapeseed oils,"" FAO said. International palm oil prices continued to increase in March, underpinned by seasonally lower output in leading producing countries, which coincided with firm domestic demand in southeast Asia. However, global prices of soyoil recovered from multi-year lows, mostly due to robust demand from the biofuel sector, particularly in the US and Brazil. Similarly, sunflower and rapeseed oil prices recovered amid rising global import demand. Higher crude oil prices also contributed to the increase in vegetable oil prices, according to the report. The dairy price index was up 2.9% on month at 124.2 points in March, marking the second consecutive monthly increase, though it was down 8.2% on year. In March, global cheese prices rose the most, reflecting the steady import demand from Asia, higher sales in western Europe and a seasonal drop in production in Oceania. International butter prices increased further in March, mainly due to good seasonal demand and somewhat tighter stocks in Europe. The meat price index was up 1.7% on month at 113.0 points in March, the second consecutive monthly increase. On year, it was down 1.5%. International poultry meat prices increased in March, underpinned by steady demand from leading importing countries. Prices of pork also increased, mainly reflecting higher internal demand ahead of the Easter holidays, notwithstanding increased supplies, especially in Western Europe. ""World bovine meat prices continued to rise in March, mainly due to increased purchases by leading importing countries,"" the agency said. The sugar price index fell 5.4% on month to 133.1 points in March after two consecutive monthly increases due to a decline in international sugar price quotations, mainly driven by the upward revision of the 2023-24 sugar production forecast in India and the improved pace of sugar harvest in Thailand at the final stage of the season.On year, however, sugar prices were up 4.8%. Persisting concerns over the crop in Brazil, negatively affected by prolonged dry weather conditions, continued to exacerbate seasonal trends and limit the drop in prices. Higher international crude oil prices also helped limit the fall in global sugar prices, the report said.

Taking Stock: Market nears record high on final trading day of FY24 For the March F&O series and for a month, the Nifty50 index gained 1.6 percent, while in the FY24 the index surged by 28.6 percent... Read More While markets may witness wild fluctuations due to valuations of benchmark indices being in an expensive zone, the undertone still remains bullish as investors are willing to bet big on equity assets for the next financial year too. While focus will shift to full year earnings from next month, sectors like banking and IT companies will be in focus going ahead. Although corrections at every interval will provide investors an opportunity to revisit mid & small-cap stocks, large-cap stocks could attract more attention going ahead. Today being the last day of FY24, it makes sense to analyze what worked and what didn't in this fiscal. It was one of the best years for Indian markets. Nifty was one of the best-performing markets in Asia with almost 29% USD return (next to Japan). China and HK were big underperformers. In India, it was more of the Mid and Small-cap Index that gave phenomenal returns relative to Nifty, almost 2.2-2.4x returns. despite some corrections in the last month. Within the broader index, it was mainly PSU stocks, auto, energy, and pharma that have given good returns, whereas consumer and Pvt banks have struggled while the IT sector has broadly remained a silent spectator. FII we're active on both sides but will end the year on a positive note whereas DII who pumped a big chunk of money into the market, gave a good fillip. Nifty & Nifty Bank register gains over 2% for two straight series 31 Nifty stocks give positive returns; HDFC Life, L&T, Eicher, Hero MotoCorp, Kotak Bank, ITC, IndusInd & Titan are amongst top Nifty Gainers TCS, Dr Reddy’s, Shriram Finance & SBI Life are top Nifty losers Nifty rises 30% in FY24 to post biggest returns (ex-covid year) since 2010 All sectoral indices rise In FY24; Realty, PSU, Power & Auto gain the most 48 of 50 Nifty stocks give positive returns in FY24, 5 of them have doubled Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Adani Ports, Coal India & Hero MotoCorp rise over 100% each 11 Nifty stocks gain in the range of 60-90% in this fiscal Only 2 Nifty stocks (HDFC Bank & HUL) give negative returns in FY24  Indian equities closed the day and fiscal year on an optimistic note, with volatility by the end of the session, as buying by retails, DIIs, and FIIs surged across categories. The mid- and small-cap stocks have emerged as frontrunners, rebounding from the initial sell-off earlier in the month. An upgrade in the domestic economy forecast hints at an encouraging outlook for the stock market in FY25. However, the emphasis is on large-cap due to the persisting premium valuations of mid-cap stocks, which could pose a concern on the broad market in the short to medium term. After a period of bullish resurgence, the Bank Nifty index exhibited strength by surpassing the 20-day moving average hurdle set at 47,000, backed by significant volumes. Despite this, it faced resistance around the 47,500 mark. A decisive breach above this resistance could propel the index towards the 48,000 level. Conversely, the immediate support is situated at the 47,000-46,800 zone. A conclusive drop below this support level, especially on a closing basis, might indicate a false breakout scenario. The Nifty has rallied significantly, surpassing the 22,500 mark after maintaining momentum beyond 22,100. Furthermore, there's a clear breakout in consolidation on the daily timeframe, signaling rising optimism. Nevertheless, the Nifty encountered initial resistance near its previous swing high of 22,526. Consequently, to sustain a continued rally, it must surpass the 22,525 level decisively. On the downside, 22,200 could serve as short-term support. The rupee traded with weakness as the strength of the dollar index exerted pressure. The rupee dropped to 83.40, down 0.07rs, while the dollar index traded with gains of 0.40$ at 104.40$, surpassing the resistance of 104$. Additionally, the rise in crude oil prices further contributed to the weakness in the rupee. Indian rupee ended marginally lower at 83.40 per dollar versus Previous close of 83.37. Market extended the winning run on the second consecutive day on March 28 with benchmark indices went closer to record high. At close, the Sensex was up 655.04 points or 0.90 percent at 73,651.35, and the Nifty was up 203.20 points or 0.92 percent at 22,326.90.

The surge also comes after domestic brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher in a thematic report highlighted that technicals suggest further upside in these stocks. What's driving defence stocks? Global geo-political tensions and India’s rising focus on self-reliance is fueling order flow and revenue growth for domestic defence companies, analysts at Jefferies said in their latest report. According to the brokerage, when it comes to the defence segment, the government's focus on building country-to-country relations to promote exports is another advantage. Additionally, nearly 2x in growth in domestic defence spend for FY24E to FY30E should continue to drive stock upside. ""We believe India’s capital defence spend should continue at the 7-8 percent CAGR seen in the last decade while an indigenisation focus will drive double-digit growth in domestic defence spend,"" said Jefferies. Another area of opportunity for the segment, according to the foreign brokerage, is exports. Export defence opportunity could rise at 21 percent CAGR in FY23-30E, it noted. India’s defence exports rose 16x in FY17-24E to $3 billion, and Jefferies estimates this to grow to $7 billion by FY30E with opportunities in UAE, Bhutan, Ethiopia, Italy and Egypt, amongst others.

Recently, the index found significant support at the 13-week EMA (exponential moving average) and formed a notable Bullish Opening Marubozu candle pattern on the weekly charts, reinforcing the prevailing upward trend. The index has broken out of an inverted head-and-shoulder pattern on the daily charts (not a classic one), suggesting heightened bullish momentum. Key technical indicators, including the relative strength index (RSI), are showing positive readings above 60 across weekly, and monthly scales, signalling favourable momentum conditions. In terms of levels, immediate resistance is identified at 22,530, a level of significant importance on higher time frames, with further resistance seen at 22,800 followed by 23,170. On the flip side, crucial support levels are observed at 22,000 and 21,700. Given the current chart patterns, a strong bullish phase is anticipated for the longer term. Therefore, it is recommended to look for buying opportunities above the 22,530 level, with potential upside targets ranging from 22,800 to 23,170. To effectively manage risks, it is advisable to implement a strict stop-loss strategy at 22,000 on a closing basis.

Additionally, the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) study indicates increasing values in the positive territory, further reinforce the bullish momentum. Moreover, on the ratio chart of SBI against Nifty, a polarity observed from the 2022 swing indicates a continuation of its outperformance. Going ahead, we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 881. The bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 692 level.  Aegis Logistics: Buy | LTP: Rs 446.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 405 | Target: Rs 557 | Return: 25 percent Aegis Logistics has seen significant chart development following a rally since March 2022.

The RSI study consistently remains above 60 across various timeframes, further confirming the breakout driven by bullish momentum. Additionally, on the ratio chart comparing Aegis Logistics against Nifty, a base formation suggests the beginning of an outperformance trend. Going ahead, we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 557. The bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 405 level.

After a healthy retracement from January 2024 following a sharp upward move, the stock has found support on the 26-week exponential moving average, suggesting a mean reversion scenario. Additionally, a change of polarity has been observed, where the resistance of May 2021 now acts as a strong support, signaling a continuation of the upward momentum. On the daily scale, the stock has formed a double bottom formation, indicating alignment between lower and higher timeframes for an upward trajectory. Notably, the momentum indicator RSI has shown a polarity shift, suggesting a change in momentum that could contribute to an upward path. Looking forward, there is an anticipation of further price ascent towards Rs 1,314 mark. It is recommended to set a stop-loss at Rs 1,007, strictly based on the closing basis.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hot-stocks-heres-why-you-should-bet-on-bajaj-finserv-and-ncc-for-short-term-12593771.html,"The Nifty50 index concluded the first week (of the new financial year) in the positive terrain, procuring around 0.84 percent to settle a tad above the 22,500 zone, remarking a highest-ever weekly closure. It had been an eventful week, both on the global and domestic fronts, and the in-line expectation of the status quo by the weekend from the MPC ignited some fire in the banking space. Overall, both the key indices complement their remarkable moves in the week with solid participation from the broader markets, suggesting a robust undertone. From here, if we do not see any aberrations from global peers, rather there could be a strong leg of rally in the upcoming week. From a technical standpoint, as the Nifty index has headed into an uncharted territory, it becomes difficult to surface the intermediate resistance, but looking at the recent developments, another leg of 200-300 point (22,700-22,800) rally could be seen on the cards under favourable scenarios. On the lower end, strong support is seen around 22,350-22,300, which certainly has proved its mettle in the previous week, followed by the sacrosanct support at 22,200. Going ahead, global developments over the weekend might set the immediate tone, and hence, a close tab is required to keep on the global bourses. Also, looking at the bullish bias, the domestic market looks prominent to continue its upward trajectory until any aberrations occur on any front. We would advocate traders to refrain from complacency and maintain a pragmatic approach with a stock-centric view for outperformance. Here are two buy calls for short term: Bajaj Finserv: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,677.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,608 | Target: Rs 1,740-1,750 | Return: 4 percent Bajaj Finserv has strongly recouped from the 200 SMA (simple moving average) in the last couple of trading weeks and has decisively surpassed the crucial hurdle of Rs 1,645-1,655. On the daily chart, the counter seems to witness a ‘flag’ pattern breakout, suggesting a buoyant potential upside in the coming period. On the oscillator front, the significant technical indicators are very much in line with the bullish development, adding a strong undertone to the counter. Hence, we recommend buying Bajaj Finserv around Rs 1,660-1,650, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,608 and target of Rs 1,740-1,750. NCC: Buy | LTP: Rs 272.70 | Stop-Loss: Rs 250 | Target: Rs 290 | Return: 6 percent NCC witnessed a decisive spurt in price volume in the last trading session, soaring to record highs. The counter is also in a secular uptrend, hovering in a cycle of higher highs and lower lows on all time frames, adding a bullish undertone. From a technical standpoint, the 14-period RSI (relative strength index) and MACD (moving average convergence divergence) both signal a positive crossover, suggesting the counter looks poised to continue its northward journey in a comparable period. Hence, we recommend buying NCC around Rs 268-260, with a stop-loss of Rs 250 and target of Rs 290.

We believe the correction has not started, as the trend is still up even on a short-term basis. Last week's fall has triggered an hourly sell signal nothing more. The overhyped PSU and power, metal have corrected as expected, and in some cases more than expected, and there could be a further correction of 10 to 15 percent more in the coming few days. As we had mentioned most things have started falling into place. Technical – As of now only the hourly signal is sell and below 21,850, the sell signal on short-term TimeMap will get triggered. The signal is matching perfectly with the bearish Nakshatra, which means the downtrend could continue for the next 45 days before we see a major recovery. The weekly sell signal gets triggered at 21190, with the first target of 20490 and 20050, this will be achieved before May 10th, 2024.

We had mentioned in the last week, that overall masses tend to overreact to slight external events, and the SEBI chief’s caution was taken so negatively, and including funds, the retailers just started panic selling in small and midcaps. Time mapping helps to understand & read the minds of the crowd behaviour, which in turn helps our FM AYAN ANALYTICS (FUND MANAGER) system to make calculative decisions. Since our FM system was anticipating, it after the confirmations, the system will start taking decisions, and throw the execution advice. Weekly Map is showing a positive week ahead, any panic selling from Monday to Wednesday, try to buy oversold reversal stocks. SUN transit in 27 Nakshatra will be presented here onwards in the weekly write-ups. Readers can keep the records and use them in future years as well. Nakshatra Uttara-Bhadrapada – SUN sign Pisces. From March 17 to the 30, the Nakshatra Uttara-Bhadrapada will be in focus. Governed by Saturn, this Nakshatra doesn't offer the most auspicious placement for the Sun. As the 12th position in the Zodiac representsMoksha, symbolizing liberation from past experiences and the commencement of new ventures, individuals may find themselves clearing existing obstacles before embarking on fresh endeavors. Communication within this Nakshatra tends to be methodical and systematic, prioritising scalability and long-term perspectives. These traits align with the archetype of a protector or warrior, striving to safeguard those in their circle. Positioned in the sign of Pisces, known for its sensitivity to external stimuli, individuals may feel easily affected by even slight changes in weather or market sentiments, leading to restlessness and heightened emotions. The response of the masses or crowd is excessive, overreacting to small external factors. Saturn's influence suggests a tendency towards safety, restriction, control, and rationality, often manifesting in a preference for capital safety, and high dividend yield equity investment. EVERY Nakshatra is divided into four parts – each part is known as Navmaunsh, the 3rd and 4th parts of the Nakshatra are strong, and can create a powerful impact on an area, community, or group of people, etc. who tend to behave in a particular direction or manner. The Period is March 24 to March 31st. Industries such as hospitality, medical tourism, BPO call centers, and media are well-suited to thrive during this period. Additionally, sectors like shipping, logistics, and tourism stand to benefit directly. Notable figures like Warren Buffet, who possess a significant influence of this Nakshatra in their horoscope, often demonstrate a propensity for altruism and generosity, directing resources towards the welfare of others. The negative side of the Nakshatra, there exists a shadow aspect characterised by short-temperedness and potential struggles with desires. This passionate yet secretive disposition may occasionally lead to cunning or duplicitous behavior. Weekly view: March 18, 2024: Monday: S.9: Aardra: Investment Day Gap Down opening is expected. A high probability last week’s low will get broken today, which will trigger a 2nd wave of panic selling in the markets. Tithi 9 or Navami – has often given the best short-sell trades, especially in the 2nd part of the Tithi. Nakshatra Aardra – Symbolic Tear in the Eye, it represents pain and sorrow, in the stock market M2M is the biggest pain, operators, and derivative traders might feel the pinch. We recommend looking for oversold reversal signals post-lunch session. Buy today, Sell tomorrow (BTST) is recommended. The banking sector, and small-cap stocks will witness aggressive buying towards EOD. March 19, 2024: Tuesday: S.10: Punervasu: Auspicious Day Higher openings of indices are expected. Market sentiment would be much better and won’t be surprised to see a lot of buying in small, midcap, and turnaround stories. Tithi gives a nice corrective move, and contrarian participation gives a nice, profiting opportunity. Nakshatra Punervasu – as the name suggests is best for turnaround companies and mean reversion indicators. STBT in selective stocks indicated. March 20, 2024: Wednesday: S.11: Pushya: ETF & Mutual Fund SIP Day A higher opening of indices is expected. The confidence is low, and while higher opening generally attracts aggressive buying, in the current situation we do not see that happening today, instead at the higher levels, markets will witness a lot of selling pressure from the institutional investors, and even HNI investors. BTST and long investment are highly recommended. Technology is the sector that might show major negative signals on charts. The steel sector needs a watch, and BTST is recommended. Also read:More than 200 small-cap stocks decline 10-40%, drive markets 2% into red March 21, 2024: Thursday: S.12: Ashlesha: Big move day The gap in the opening will give the direction to the market. Higher openings mean markets will close in big positive. In the natural resource sector, metal stocks will hog the limelight, and we won’t be surprised to see steel stocks especially attracting the highest investors' interest. Momentum Breakout signals give the best results on Tithi 12 and Aggressive Nakshatra Ashlesha. We suggest being strict with Stops, and positions in favor should be continued till the end of the day. BTST in Capital goods and Automobile sector. March 22, 2024: Friday: S.13: Magha: Bullish Friday the 13th carries with it an ingrained sense of fear. Most individuals will exercise great caution and may choose to engage only when they perceive a sense of absolute clarity acknowledged by their consciousness. We are expecting a lot of institutional buying in select stocks, especially PSUs, cement, and banks. We believe markets will give a positive close on a weekly basis.

Morgan Stanley has an 'equal-weight' rating on PB Fintech with a target price of Rs 1,010 per share. Notably, ICICI Lombard was absent from Policybazaar's online retail platform for an extended period.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/these-3-stocks-may-give-up-to-15-short-term-return-despite-tug-of-war-between-bulls-and-bears-12517291.html,"Last week's trading on the D-Street proved to be a roller coaster ride for investors. Initially, the benchmark indices faced significant pressure, particularly with the Nifty 50 breaching the support level of 22,000 and nearly testing the 21,700 mark. However, a notable recovery ensued during the later half of the week, facilitating a swift bounce-back. Despite the turbulence, the index managed to close above the crucial 22,000 mark, thanks to a sharp pullback. From a technical standpoint, the Nifty spot index retraced to its 50-day exponential moving average (DEMA) and exhibited a bullish Harmonic Shark pattern near the 21,750 level, resulting in a substantial bounce of over 400 points from its lows. Currently, there are indications of a Morning Star candlestick pattern forming on the daily chart, alongside an Inverse Head and Shoulder breakout on the hourly chart of the Nifty spot. Therefore, as long as the support level of 21,700 holds, a buy-on-dips stance is advisable. However, a breach of 21,700 could potentially lead the index towards the 21,600 – 21,500 range, corresponding to the placement of the 100-day DEMA. On the upside, the levels of 22,200 – 22,450 are anticipated to pose strong resistance in the current week starting from March 26. Notably, the current week is truncated with only three trading sessions, and there's a breakout in the USDINR pair, causing the INR to trade at an all-time low. These factors are expected to contribute to heightened volatility in the market during the coming week. The Nifty Bank index has recently reversed direction from the rising trendline, coinciding with the placement of the 100-day exponential moving average (DEMA). Looking ahead to the current week, breaching the level of 45,800 could be pivotal for the index's performance. On the upside, a significant obstacle lies at the 48,000 mark, and only a breakthrough beyond this level might empower the index to outpace the benchmark indices, indicating a potential shift towards stronger performance in the market. Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks: Borosil Renewables: Buy | LTP: Rs 523.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 475 | Target: Rs 600 | Return: 14.6 percent After surging to its peak near Rs 670 mark on February 1, 2024, Borosil Renewables has undergone a notable downturn, witnessing a substantial decline of around 28 percent. However, over the subsequent 26 trading sessions, Borosil Renewables has demonstrated resilience, avoiding further downturns and instead consolidating within a range spanning from Rs 480 to Rs 515. From a technical perspective, there's been the formation of a bullish AB=CD pattern evident on the daily chart of Borosil Renewables within this specified price range of Rs 480-515. Interestingly, this range aligns with the 0.618 percent retracement level of a price swing observed between October 2023 and January 2024, as depicted on the chart. Moreover, on the daily scale, the relative strength index (RSI) has surpassed its bearish trendline, indicating a potentially attractive buying opportunity.Consequently, it may be prudent to consider buying within the range of Rs 510-525, targeting an upside of Rs 600, while setting a stop-loss near Rs 475 on a daily closing basis. Coal India: Buy | LTP: Rs 432 | Stop-Loss: Rs 408 | Target: Rs 465 | Return: 7.6 percent Following a peak near Rs 465 mark on March 7, 2024, Coal India underwent a notable decline of approximately 12 percent. However, from a technical perspective, a bullish AB=CD pattern has emerged on daily chart of Coal India within the price range of Rs 410-420. Remarkably, this range aligns with the 0.50 percent retracement level of a price swing observed between January 2024 and February 2024, as depicted on the chart. Furthermore, a bullish cross has been observed on the 2-hourly Stochastic indicator, signaling a potentially attractive buying opportunity. Consequently, investors may consider initiating long positions within Rs 420-435 zone, targeting an upside objective of Rs 465. It's advisable to set a stop-loss near Rs 408 on a daily closing basis to manage downside risk effectively.  Bajaj Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,761 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,350 | Target: Rs 7,400 | Return: 9.5 percent Bajaj Finance experienced a significant decline near Rs 8,200 mark on October 6, 2023, shedding around 2,000 rupees. However, it stabilised within a range of Rs 6,400 to Rs 6,600, avoiding further declines. During the previous week, there was significant buying interest and substantial trading volume. A bullish AB=CD pattern appeared on the daily chart, aligning with the 0.618 percent to 0.707 percent retracement levels of a price swing between March and October 2023. The daily stochastic indicator formed a bullish divergence, signaling a potential buying opportunity. Thus one can buy in the zone of Rs 6,600-6,800 with an upside target of Rs 7,400 and a stop-loss would be placed near Rs 6,350 on a daily close basis.

At close, the Sensex was up 190.75 points or 0.26 percent at 72,831.94, and the Nifty was up 84.80 points or 0.39 percent at 22,096.80. We wrap up today's edition of the Moneycontrol live market blog, and will be back on Tuesday morning with all the latest updates and alerts. Please visithttps://www.moneycontrol.com/markets/global-indicesfor all the global market action. Domestic equities joined the global rally after the US and UK central banks kept the rate unchanged. Nifty after a subdued start edged higher to close with gains of 85 points (+0.4%) at 22097 levels. Broader market too ended in the green. Barring IT, all sectors ended in green with Auto, Pharma, and Realty being top gainers. IT sector saw some selling after US technology major Accenture lowered its revenue forecast for FY24. Accenture revised its full-year revenue growth projection at 1 % to 3 % from 2 % to 5 %. Markets opened weak but soon gained momentum including broader space amid positive cues. Next week being a truncated week and the derivatives' monthly expiry, we might see some volatility while Nifty is likely to consolidate at higher levels. Also, US GDP data and other key economic data would keep investors busy. Taking Stock: Sensex gains 191 points, Nifty at 22,100; auto, realty shine, IT drags Top Nifty gainers included UPL, Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and Sun Pharma, while losers were Wipro, Infosys, LTIMindtree, HCL Technologies and TCS... Read More Markets traded volatile but managed to end higher, tracking favorable global cues. After the initial downtick, Nifty inched gradually higher for most of the session however profit taking in the final hour trimmed the gains. Eventually, it settled at 22096.75; up by 0.39%. Meanwhile, a majority of sectors ended higher wherein realty, auto and pharma were among the top performers. The broader indices also extended rebound and gained over half a percent each. Participants are taking comfort from the favorable global cues however Nifty is still facing a hurdle around the short term moving average i.e. 20 DEMA. We reiterate our view to focus on stock selection and trade management until we get some clarity over the next directional move. Nifty witnessed two days of recovery following adojiformation on the daily chart, indicating a bullish reversal. Moreover, the Nifty has reclaimed the critical 55-day exponential moving average. However, Nifty needs to cross over 22,100 to witness a clear rally towards the all-time high of 22,525. The domestic market swiftly rebounded from an initial downturn and maintained a positive trajectory throughout the day, buoyed by favourable global cues driven by dovish comments from the BoE and buying activity at lower levels in the wake of a recent sell-off. Additionally, the retreat of crude oil prices from recent highs contributed to the positive sentiment. While most sectors experienced gains, the IT remained in the red due to subdued guidance from Accenture, a major global IT player. Markets displayed volatility but managed to end higher amid gains in realty, telecom and auto stocks whereas IT stocks faltered sharply after Accenture slashed its full-year revenue guidance which renewed concerns of the sector in an uncertain global environment. FIIs offloading shares of domestic equities coupled with a sharp fall in the currency level has been indicating that the road ahead for equity markets could be bumpy. The Nifty opened at a gap down today. However, it recovered and closed with gains. On the daily charts we can observe that the index is in the process of retracing the fall it has witnessed from 22526 – 21710. The key retracement levels are placed at 22118 – 22214. The dip found buying interest at 21900 – 21880 where the 20-hour moving average was placed. The retracement process is still not complete and hence the rally can continue. The daily and hourly momentum indicator is providing a divergent signal which can lead to consolidation. The range is likely to be 22200 – 21900. Stock specific action is likely to continue during this period. Bank Nifty also consolidated within a narrow range around the key daily moving averages. On the upside the key retracement level can continue till 47000 – 47200 over the next few trading sessions. The crucial support zone is placed at 46500 – 46400. Nifty witnessed two days of recovery following adojiformation on the daily chart, indicating a bullish reversal. Moreover, the Nifty has reclaimed the critical 55-day exponential moving average. However, Nifty needs to cross over 22,100 to witness a clear rally towards the all-time high of 22,525. The Bank Nifty index saw robust buying from lower levels but struggled to breach the resistance at 47,000. Immediate support lies at 46,600-46,500, and as long as the index holds above this level, the outlook remains bullish. A breakthrough above 47,000 is anticipated to trigger sharp short-covering rallies towards the 48,000 mark. The rupee traded weak, dropping by more than 0.25 to below 83.37, as the dollar index rallied above 104.08. This added pressure on the rupee following a positive gap up opening witnessed yesterday at 83.05. The rupee has fallen sharply by more than 0.30rs from its high of 83.05 over the last two days. Despite the dovish view on interest rates in the US, specific data-driven interest rate cuts are still distant. The rupee's range can be expected to be between 82.85-83.55, with volatility likely to persist. Gold prices experienced a correction over the last two days, influenced by a rise in the dollar index and profit booking following a strong bullish rally in March, which saw prices climb from 63000 to 66900. Despite this correction, the overall outlook for gold remains positive. However, some volatility and further correction may be expected in the near term. Gold is anticipated to trade within a range of 65250-66500.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/indigo-shares-fly-to-record-high-as-brokerages-foresee-strong-growth-raise-price-targets-12521681.html,"Shares of IndiGo operator InterGlobe Aviation surged around 6 percent to a record high of Rs 3,489.85 by afternoon trade on March 26 morning as a slew of brokerages rolled out strong growth forecasts for the low-cost carrier after its analysts meet. Shares ofInterGlobe Aviationclosed 5.92 percent higher at Rs 3,480 apiece on BSE. After the analyst meet on March 22, brokerages such as UBS Securities, Kotak Institutional Equities and Motilal Oswal Financial Services see a strong growth potential for IndiGo on the back of its expansion plans and strong growth projections for the country's aviation industry. Motilal Oswal Financial Services feels that the Indian aviation market is highly underpenetrated currently, which provides huge room for growth for domestic players. The firm believes that the growth trajectory for domestic will be aided by increasing airport infrastructure and capacity additions in terms of aircraft orders, which could make India the third-largest aviation market in the world by 2035. Other brokerages remain equally optimistic on the long-term growth outlook for the domestic air travel industry, with projections indicating a robust 15 percent compounded annual growth rate over FY24-30. Brokerages have assigned price targets ranging from Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,300 for IndiGo, reflecting a potential upside of 7-31 percent from the previous close. UBS Securities raised its target price by 2.5 percent to Rs 4,000, valuing the stock at 11 times its expected FY26 EV/EBITDA. Even with considerations for increased crude prices and pilot salaries, UBS's projections remain bullish, driven by improved Available Seat Kilometer (ASK) growth and yields. However, the firm did highlight some potential upside risks to its yield estimates for IndiGo in the short term, as well as to capacity demand growth and profitability in the medium term. Follow our live blog for all the market action ""We maintain our positive stance on IndiGo considering strong growth prospects of the Indian aviation industry, share gains in international travel, efficient cost structure and operational excellence,"" UBS said, as it retained its ""buy"" call on the stock. Kotak also highlighted the shift in IndiGo's focus on connectivity to have a larger share of international journeys and investing in systems and operations. ""The near-term outlook is comforting on both ASK growth and pricing, reflective of IndiGo’s planning and strength of the underlying demand,"" the brokerage said in a note. Kotak raised its target price for the stock to Rs 4,300 while retaining its ""buy"" call. ICICI Securities also has a positive view on InterGlobe Aviation led by favourable demand-supply equation and its strong position (balance sheet, market share, management strength and orderbook). Having met FY24 guidance on all fronts, IndiGo aims for early double-digit growth in capacity/passenger in FY25. ICICI Securities sees this in a good light considering the impact of grounding. The brokerage has a 'buy' call on the stock with a price target of Rs 4,009. MOFSL also stands impressed by IndiGo's three-pillar strategy for growth, namely, affordable fares, lower cancellations and on-time performance. It also seeks to enhance customer experience and invest in talent. Even though MOFSL remains optimistic, it still chose to retain its 'neutral' rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 3,510 as it believes the low-cost carrier would need to navigate through various challenges in the near to medium term.

Our recommendation is primarily based on 1). Leading player in demand-rich region, i.e., Central India, 2). Capacity addition and volume growth higher than the industry average, 3). Improved cost-efficiency, 4). Less dependency on grid on the back of higher usage of captive coal mines, 5). Strong focus on premiumisation, 6). Incentive-based plants and 7) Healthy balance sheet with better return ratios. Despite having an intense competition in central region, BCORP’s major focus on premium segment sale, cost optimization, and strong branding with marketing strategy has enable it to strengthen the market share. BCORP’s Mukutban Plant (unit of RCCPL) utilization rate has improved to 60% in 3QFY24 vs. 40% in 2QFY24 and has started delivering positive EBITDA. We believe that there will be continued focus on plant modernization and improvement in cost structure to deliver higher EBITDA for Mukutban Plant, going forward. We expect revenue/EBITDA growth of 8%/ 40% CAGR over FY23-FY26E, driven by strong volumes and improved cost efficiency.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/indicator-flashes-buy-on-33-nifty-smallcap-stocks-as-bulls-return-to-broader-markets-12534541.html,"While the broader markets saw a sharp sell-off earlier this month, a partial recovery in the smallcap indices since March 13 has helped revive the sentiment for smaller stocks. The percentage of the Nifty Smallcap 100 index stocks trading above their 20-day simple moving averages (SMA) has jumped to over 33 percent from 2 percent on March 13, when the negative sentiment was at its peak. Source : web.strike.money At the beginning of the year, at least 90 percent of the Nifty Smallcap 100 index stocks were seen trading above their 20-day SMA. Up to 40 percent rise from March lows At least 53 smallcaps from the pack of 250 smallcap index constituents have gained more than 10 percent since March 13, and as many as 113 stocks have recovered more than 5 percent. Swan Energy has gained by 40 percent, GPPL is up by 25 percent, Apar Industries by 21 percent, Hindustan Copper by 21 percent and Jamna Auto by 21 percent since the panic sell-off in broader markets. The Nifty Smallcap 250 index itself has recovered by 6 percent from March lows. Earnings growth backs rally in smallcaps, midcaps The earnings growth in midcap and smallcap firms has been the key trigger for up to 61 percent rally in broader market indices over the past two years. The Nifty Smallcap 150 index PE has expanded by about 10 percent in this period on the back of a 53 percent growth in earnings. This shows that the valuations may have increased in some pockets of the broader market, but earnings growth has been supportive of the rally over a couple of years, according to Purvesh Shelatkar, head of institutional broking at Monarch Networth Capital. ""For the recovery to sustain its momentum, earnings growth will be key in coming quarters,"" he said. Earnings growth supported the rally in smallcap index In a recent report, UBS said that the earnings trend of Indian companies continues to be strong, but regulators’ concerns about froth in small and midcap stocks, speculation in options, and a rapid rise in retail credit may affect tailwinds. Given the concerns on valuations and observations by the market regulator, smallcaps and midcaps may not see the frenzy buying seen in 2022 and 2023, according to Darpan Patil, founder of Rupic Consultancy. Should you rush? Experts are quick to caution that looking at the indices may not be a smart way to seek opportuni.ties in the broader markets. ""When it comes to smallcaps and midcaps, I prefer to study individual stocks and take a bottom-up approach, rather than look at the indices for valuation. Also, it is advisable to take a minimum of three-five-year view while taking exposure to smallcaps and midcaps,” Kunal Pawaskar, principal officer and head of portfolio management services at Tata Asset Management, said.

The corporation holds auctions from Monday to Friday and endeavours to liquidate stocks before the commencement of the next season on Oct 1. Since February, the corporation sells cotton bales only to spinning mills through the auctions. Previously, traders and exporters were also permitted in auctions. Apart from extending support to farmers by buying cotton at minimum support price, the corporation also acts as a dependable supplier to the textile industry. As prices turned volatile, spinning mills had requestedCotton Corp in February to sell cotton only to the textile industry. Average cotton prices of Shankar-6 variety in Gujarat were 59,350-61,600 rupees per candy (1 candy = 356 kg). In Maharashtra, the 29-30 mm variety was 60,450-61,850 rupees per candy, according to Global Cotton Advisory. Cotton is a kharif crop sown in Apr-Jul and harvested from Aug-Sep.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-you-should-deal-in-maruti-suzuki-praj-industries-and-bse-today-12497741.html,"Considering the bullish crossover in momentum indicators (MACD - moving average convergence divergence) and RSI (relative strength index) on hourly charts and smart recovery from the day's low in the previous session with a Doji candlestick pattern formation after red candle on daily charts, the Nifty 50 may make an attempt to rebound with resistance at the 21,900-22,000 area in the coming session, while the support lies at 21,800, and then at 21,700, experts said. On March 20, the Nifty 50 recovered more than 100 points from the day's low and settled 22 points higher at 21,839 ahead of the meeting of the Federal Reserve which maintained Fed funds rate at 5.25-5.50 percent and continued to signal for three rate cuts this year. The BSE Sensex was up 90 points at 72,102, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices ended flat. Stocks that recorded better performance than the benchmarks and broader markets included Maruti Suzuki India, Praj Industries, and BSE.Maruti Suzuki Indiarallied 3 percent to end at record closing high of Rs 11,941 and formed a long, bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts after breaking the consolidation of last couple of weeks as well as seeing breakout of horizontal resistance trendline adjoining highs of February 23 and March 5, with healthy volumes, while trading above all key moving averages. Praj Industriesclimbed above all key moving averages in a single day and rallied 9.4 percent to Rs 518, forming robust bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with significantly higher volumes. In fact, it has seen a decisive breakout of long downward sloping resistance trendline, which is a positive sign. BSEclimbed 4 percent to Rs 2,033 and formed a bullish engulfing candlestick (trend reversal) pattern on the daily charts after downtrend, with above average volumes, though it traded below 21, 50 and 100-day EMAs (exponential moving averages). Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: Maruti Suzuki India In recent market movements, Maruti has shown a consolidation around the 21-day exponential moving average (DEMA) subsequent to reaching a Double Top formation near Rs 11,700 mark. However, in the most recent trading session, the stock exhibited a significant breakthrough above Rs 11,700 level, closing near Rs 11,940. This breakout is particularly notable as the daily stochastic oscillator has reversed direction from the 50 levels, indicating a potentially bullish momentum. Consequently, there appears to be an attractive opportunity at the current juncture. It is suggested that investors can consider initiating long positions within the range of Rs 11,850-Rs 12,000, with an upside target at Rs 12,500. To manage risk, a stop-loss order should be placed near Rs 11,625 on a daily closing basis.  BSE Following a peak near Rs 2,599 level, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) underwent a significant downturn, experiencing a sharp decline of 25 percent in its overall value. However, over the course of the week, BSE has managed to stabilize around Rs 2,000 level, forming a sustained support base. Notably, during this period, a bullish AB=CD pattern has emerged near Rs 2,000 level, providing further confirmation of positive market sentiment. Additionally, analysis of the 3-hour stochastic indicator reveals a bullish divergence, indicating a favourable outlook for the stock. Considering these factors alongside chart patterns, investors may find it prudent to consider initiating buy positions within the range of Rs 2,000-2,050, with an upside objective targeted at Rs 2,300. To manage risk, a stop-loss order should be set at Rs 1,890 on a daily closing basis, providing protection against potential downside movements. Praj Industries Since reaching a high of Rs 650 on November 30, 2023, Praj has undergone a notable decline, shedding nearly 31 percent in its price. Presently, the stock has demonstrated resilience by closing above the 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA) and finding support at this crucial technical level. Additionally, a significant development on the daily chart is the breach of the bear line, coinciding with the vicinity between 0.382-0.50 percent retracement level of its previous upward movement, indicating a potential reversal in the downtrend. Moreover, the daily stochastic indicator has exhibited bullish divergence, as indicated in the accompanying chart, further bolstering the bullish sentiment surrounding the stock. Given these technical signals, investors might consider initiating buy positions within the range of Rs 490-520, with an upside target set at Rs 600. To mitigate risk, a stop-loss order should be placed near Rs 460 on a daily closing basis, ensuring protection against adverse price movements.

Here's what you should gather from World Street on its April 3 edition: Crude at 6-month high Oil prices surged to their highest point since October on April 2, driven by investor attention to emerging supply risks stemming from heightened tensions in the Middle East and a Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian oil facility. The US West Texas Intermediate contract for May delivery increased by $1.44, or 1.72 percent, closing at $85.15 per barrel, while the Brent contract for June delivery rose by $1.53, or 1.75 percent, reaching $88.94 per barrel. Copper gathers shine Copper surged past the $9,000-per-tonne mark again as investors assessed positive factory data from China, its leading consumer, alongside the possibility of production reductions by top smelting companies in the country. Investor sentiment is bolstered by encouraging signs from the world's second-largest economy, highlighted by March's official manufacturing purchasing managers index hitting its highest level in a year. NATO help for Ukraine NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is suggesting the creation of a $100-billion fund from allied contributions over five years to support Ukraine.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/how-a-govt-healthcare-scheme-is-boosting-pharma-revenues-12487241.html,"The pharmaceutical industry in India grew 6.8 percent and had a Rs 1.93 lakh crore turnover in calendar year 2023. This growth was fuelled by the fast growth of domestic branded pharmaceutical companies and a government scheme that promotes the sale of generic drugs. The Rs 10,000-crore generics market forms a small segment of the Indian pharmaceutical market. It is dominated by Cipla, Alkem, and the Jan Aushadhi scheme. The Jan Aushadhi scheme, a central government scheme, aims to provide quality medicines at affordable prices (at least 50 percent cheaper, and in some cases, up to 90 percent cheaper). What is the Jan Aushadhi scheme and why was it launched? The Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched by the Department of Pharmaceuticals to provide quality medicines at affordable prices to the masses through special kendras (Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana Kendras). The programme targets launching 20,000 new pharmacies in the upcoming fiscal year, Ravi Dadhich, chief executive officer, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Bureau of India (PMBI), the government arm that executes the scheme, had said in an earlier interview with News 18. Jan Aushadhi Kendras, which are run by private entrepreneurs with support from the government in the form of incentives, have been able to provide around 1,800 types of medicine and 300 types of surgical devices. Also read:Government issues code to check unethical drug promotion Who owns the Jan Aushadhi kendras and who supplies medicines? An individual, partnership, charitable society or a government agency submits an application to open a Jan Aushadhi Kendra. Medicines are procured through an open tender system from private manufacturers and public sector drug manufacturers. Each batch of procured drugs is tested at laboratories empanelled with the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) and then sent to the Jan Aushadhi Kendras. How has the scheme impacted the top line of domestic pharma companies? The number of Jan Aushadhi stores has increased approximately nine-fold in the last five years, with sales reaching Rs 850 crore as of December 2022 and coverage expanding 3.6 times to 1,759 drugs. “However, shortages of medicines and stock-keeping units (SKUs) persist,” said a recent report by HDFC Securities. In addition, expenditure allocation has seen a 1.6-fold increase, reaching Rs 280 crore for FY24-25, up from the revised allocation of Rs 11o crore in FY23-24, according to interim budget documents. “Patients and doctors often associate low-cost medicines with poor quality, creating a mental barrier that may delay the acceptance of generic medicines to some extent,” the HDFC Securities note adds. Kotak Securities notes that the expansion of Jan Aushadhi Kendras would hamper the growth of the branded generics market in India. “With Jan Aushadhi’s rapid expansion, there is a risk of this hit on IPM (Indian Pharmaceutical Market) swelling further. As seen earlier and more recently with NMC (National Medical Commission), the government is keen on pushing generics,” it said. The Indian Pharma Market grew in 2022 and 2024 because it was allowed to hike prices linked to WPI for the National List of Essential Medicines. On Mar 27, 2023, the NPPA announced the calculated annual change in WPI as 12.1 percent for CY22 over CY21. This translated to a significant price hike of ~12 percent (~10.8 percent in FY22) vs a normal hike of 2-3 percent for 800+ scheduled drugs and medical devices from 1 Apr 2023. Price benefits started reflecting in 9M’24 performances. However, for FY 25, in line with the wholesale price index (WPI), the government is set to allow only a .0055 percent increase in prices of drugs listed in the National List of Essential Medicines. The benefits enjoyed in the previous years will not continue in FY 25.

The company has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government’s investment in the power sector, partly helped by its multinational lineage and products, which are used in data centres and production of semiconductors. On April 10,Schneider Electric Infrastructureclosed at Rs 781, up 93 percent in the year so far. Its products in the power segment include transformers and switchgears. The company's diversified products in systems, services and transactional segments also contributed to its growth. Riding the power wave “India’s power demand is expected to double by 2045 and it is aiming for an ambitious 500 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. Capital expenditure for FY 2024-25 is estimated at Rs 11 trillion, and we see a large part of it flowing into the energy sector,” said Hemal Shah, Fund Manager of Torus ORO PMS. This can lead to huge demand in this sector in the form of grids, insulators, switchgears, transmission, smart meters, wires and cables. Schneider Electric Infra’s order book expanded 38.8 percent on-year to Rs 1,358.6 crore in the fiscal third quarter. The growth in the order book was driven by the power and grid segment, mobility and other electrosensitive segments, CFO Suparna Bhattacharyya said in a conference call in February. The order books of the company's peers CG Power and Industrial Solutions and Voltamp, grew by 34 percent while Transformers and Rectifiers India's book expanded by 71 percent in the quarter. Schneider Electric's  Q3 revenue rose 29.5 percent on-year to Rs 743.9 crore, with nearly half coming from the Power and Grid segment. Net profit more than doubled from a year ago to Rs 91 crore. Schneider's revenue and profit growth in the past year has far outpaced its competitors (except Transformers and Rectifiers, whose Q3 net profit zoomed quarter-on-quarter on a low base). Revenue comparision The company's earnings have also helped the stock beat analyst target prices. In February 2024, when it was trading at Rs 590, LKP Securities had set a target price of Rs 690 for the stock. It has already gone past that. Profit comparision New management and diversified business portfolio Elara Capital said the company’s new management, represented by MD and CEO Udai Singh, who took on the role in September 2023, has continued the growth strategy with stable margins. The firm has pivoted from taking orders on an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) basis to “a transactional mode (product via distribution),” Elara said. Schneider has moved from a production and construction (EPC) model to a product-supplier model (selling products through distributors), where the risk on receivables is lower, along with better cash flow. The strategy has increased the company’s gross margins from 30 percent in Q3FY23 to 36 percent in Q3FY24. Transactional revenue for the company also increased 60 percent on-year to Rs 160 crore in Q3. “Schneider Electric Infrastructure has consistently performed in terms of earnings in the last nine quarters. It has been diversifying its portfolio. It has been able to get repeat customers across its various product portfolios,” said Avinash Pathak, Research Analyst at LKP Securities. The company is also providing digital services. Should investors buy the Schneider Electric Infrastructure stock? After the huge rally, experts recommend it is better to wait and watch the stock and add it during dips. “Schneider’s valuations look stretched. The stock has fully priced in most of the positives. Investors should not rush to buy this stock now,” said Kranthi Bathini, Director of Equity strategies at WealthMill Securities. Shailesh Saraf, Managing director of Dynamic Equities, also said the stock was trading at expensive valuations of 90 trailing PE , but added that this is justified due to the company’s strong earnings growth. “When the profit growth is above 100 percent, it is justified. It is a good stock in a sector that has huge demand for its products,” said Saraf.

In this report, we have highlighted the current demand trend in the domestic structural tubes industry based on our channel checks. We have also underscored the company’s strategy to foray into various international geographies. Based on our channel checks, we anticipate that the overall demand scenario will continue to remain weak due to a slowdown in construction activity. The demand is likely to weaken further during the general election period owing to a delay in government projects and infrastructure spending. A majority of the dealers are operating with minimum inventory levels in anticipation of weak demand and due to the high cost of holding. We expect demand to recover strongly post-general elections (from 2QFY25) aided by the resumption of infrastructure spending and restocking of inventory by the dealers. Outlook Considering the weak sales volume in 2HFY24 and the muted demand outlook in the near term, we cut our FY24E EPS by 5%. Consequently, we reduce our FY25/ FY26 EPS estimates marginally by 4% each. We value the stock at 32x FY26E EPS to arrive at our TP of INR1,800. Reiterate BUY.

Indeed we are. In fact , we are angry. What looked a sure thing in February, has become less so in March. Why is this paradise getting lost right in front of our dewy eyes? But was it a sure thing at all in February? That's where some thinking helps.( Thinking doesn't always help though. Look at the past 4 years!). I do also understand that analytical thinking almost always is  problematic. Lazy, under-analysed, over-simplified opinions are comforting. Like chamomile tea. Analysis is four espresso shots. In the Indian model of investing that I have seen for the last 30 plus years, data are only supposed to be looked at one way and any other conflicting data are supposed to be conveniently swept under the carpet. But the millions of young investors who have entered the markets in the last four years should not grow up believing that data do not matter. Data do matter and they matter most in the stock market. That's because the stock market is never a sure thing. The stock market is nothing but a game of chance which is,  at some level, broadly equal to placing bets at a casino. Both sets of ""gambles"" have probabilistic outcomes. At the casino, however, there is a big difference: your bets are supposed to get squared up by end of playtime. In the stock market, it is not so in so far as the investing part of the stock market is concerned (not so in the derivatives part, of course). However, the fact remains that even the investing part of the stock market is a game of several probabilities in which the most probable may not actually come through and the least probable might transpire. But a good question that should be at the forefront of every investor at every point in time should be: what do the probabilities say at that point in time? And that is exactly where some basic back of the envelope data analysis helps. So here I resort to my self-created, Nobel prize-worthy ( sorry for the shameless plug) Lake of Returns Theory ( LORT). What LORT posits is every asset class has a certain finite amount of returns that it can hold and deliver. That is the Lake of that asset class'  Returns. For example, the Sensex Lake of Returns tells us that it can deliver us around 15-16% CAGR over an extended period of time. That's pretty much the amount of water (returns) the Sensex Lake can hold. Therefore,  what exactly is the Lake of Returns Theory. If any particular asset class has more or less a predictable return characteristic (most do, except Cryptocurrencies because they are too new), which is the amount of water or returns it can hold in its reservoir or lake, then we can reasonably predict future market movements based on the level of water or returns in that particular asset class in the preceding period. In a bear market, the level of water in the lake of returns falls to abysmal levels. Think of the extremely dry lake in the period mid-2000 until  early 2004. The Sensex had done precisely nothing except go down. So the volume of water in the Lake was next to 0. And then a massive wave of water filling started from 2004 onwards which lasted right until 2007 end. In that period, the Sensex compounded ~50% CAGR! And that is when sitting in my trading room, watching the screen go wild in the months of September- October 2007, that the Lake of Returns Theory hit me: like a laser beam in a dark theater.  It became so blindingly obvious to me that that bull market (04-07) was pretty much near over. And that is because while this asset class (Sensex) is supposed to deliver 15% annual return, it had given us 50%+ annual returns for the preceding 3-4 years. So now the Lake of Returns was overflowing and was close to flooding over and destroying all the villages bordering the lake. This Lake simply did not have the capacity to hold so much water and deliver it in a orderly fashion to the people living on the banks. The banks and dams had to burst and calamity had to follow and by January of 2008, the magnificent destruction was there for all to see. So what does the Lake of Returns Theory now tell us? Chew on this: SENSEX: A. The SENSEX has returned from May 2014 up until now ( ~10 years), a CAGR of ~12%. B. Importantly, from May 2014 to (pre- Covid) February 2020, Sensex returned just 9% CAGR . C. From Covid lows to present day, Sensex has returned 27% CAGR. D. From February 2020 ( pre-Covid peak ( 41k level) to present 73k), it's delivered CAGR of just ~15%. Analysis: much of the 10 year- 12% CAGR for the Sensex has come from just the post COVID rally. The returns or the level of the water in the Lake, prior to the pandemic,  was extremely low (9% CAGR, well below long term trend) . And that is exactly why the water level filled rapidly post pandemic, delivering 27% CAGR in the past 4 years. BSE Small Cap Index: E. Past 10 year returns: 18.5% CAGR F. May 2014- February 2020: ~9.5% CAGR G. Post COVID lows to present day: 47% CAGR H. February 2020 to present day: 32% CAGR. So now we have some data on the levels of water in the Lake before, during and after. What does this tell us? Well, the simple inescapable conclusion is that the Sensex has delivered extremely disappointing returns ( even worse when you adjust for volatility) over the past 10 years and even those disappointing returns have been made to look good mainly because of the returns of the preceding four years. That is extremely telling because it is telling us that large companies have probably hit a wall in terms of their ability to keep growing incessantly. But, as my Giant Wheel Theory(GWT)  posits there is always going to be action in other parts of the market if one large part of the market becomes somnolent. And so the action shifted to the small caps. How does the water level in the small cap lake look like? Well, to be absolutely honest, this Lake has filled up amazingly well with a 47% CAGR in the past four years, which is probably the best four-year period of water filling this lake has ever seen. But again what is important to see is that in the period prior to the pandemic, small cap returns were like  box office collections of Lal Singh Chaddha. Time is also an extremely important factor here when analyzing the Lake of Returns Theory. We have now had four years of an amazing bull market , especially in the small cap space. As of March 2024, we are now entering the 5th year of this relentless bull. The History of bull markets and their longevity is sobering: almost no bull market has lasted more than five years if we were to analyze around 100 years of market history. US:1967-1972; 1982-1987; 1995-2000; 2003-2007 and So on. (How I wish they would invent a drug for perennial and permanent longevity for stock bull markets! ) And this happens simply because the Lake of Returns of any asset class cannot deliver 3x its long term returns, for beyond four or five years. Smallcap  returns in India have been, very long term,  around 15-17%. We have just had four fantastic years of 47% CAGR! Can this Bull go to the 5th year and deliver something similar? We absolutely can see that happen. It is indeed possible. But how probable is that the 5th year is going to be equally strong? Well, for this, I circle back to my earlier comment that the market is all about just various outcomes which have differing probabilities attached to them. While it is very possible that we can have a fifth extremely strong year, how probable is that? In fact , as I write this, it occurs to me that there is a damn good reason why we have a Bull as the animal depicting a strong uptrend in stock markets, and not a horse. A horse is meant for long distance running,  at high speeds. A Bull is simply not built for such endeavors. Physiologically, it is far too heavy to run too fast for too long. It will tire and tire within a fairly finite period of time. The small cap bull has delivered far beyond what we thought it would. This 4-year old Bull is no longer young in its legs and hardy in its heart. The matadors are all out there with sharpened stilletos, inflicting scars on its hide: SME scams, Regulatory warnings, RBI crackdowns, funding winters, et al. Let me put it this way: The 5th year of a bull market is akin to batting on a 5th day turning track, against Tausif Ahmed and Iqbal Kasim in Bangalore, 1987. It will require the technique , ie, skill of a Sunil Gavaskar to navigate this period of play. A style like Krish Srikanth's, visible luck, invisible skill, is simply not going to work. The Game of Luck just got over. The Game of Skill begins now. Let me end on an optimistic note, though: ""Allah ke bande hans dey, Jo bhi ho kal phir ayega""

The benchmark Nifty index managed to settle the last two sessions above 22,500 amid consolidation and saw higher highs, higher lows formation for the second consecutive week, making experts hopeful of further uptrend towards 22,700-22,800 in the coming sessions, with support at 22,300-22,200 levels, and the volatility index diving to November 2023 lows. The Nifty 50 gained 0.84 percent to settle at a record closing high of 22,513.70 for the week, and formed a small bullish candlestick pattern with long upper and lower shadows, which resemble High Wave kind of candlestick pattern on the daily charts, indicating indecisiveness among bulls and bears about future market trend. From a technical standpoint, as the Nifty index heads into an uncharted territory, it becomes difficult to surface the intermediate resistance, but looking at the recent developments, another leg of 200-300 point (22,700-22,800) rally could be seen on the cards under favourable scenarios, Osho Krishan, senior analyst for technical and derivative research at Angel One, said. On the lower end, he feels strong support is expected around 22,350-22,300, which certainly has proved its mettle in the previous week, followed by the sacrosanct support at 22,200. Jigar S Patel, senior manager of equity research at Anand Rathi, also sees support at similar levels, with hurdle on the higher side at 22,600-22,800. Osho advised traders to refrain from complacency and maintain a pragmatic approach with a stock-centric view for an outperformance.

This week, BSE Sensex added 188.51 or 0.25 percent to close at 72,831.94 and the Nifty50 index rose 73.45 points or 0.33 percent to end at 22,096.80. Among sectors, the Nifty Realty index rose 5.4 percent, the Nifty Auto and Metal indices added 4 percent each, while the Nifty Information Technology index lost 6 percent. Among broader indices, the BSE Small-cap, Mid-cap, and Large-cap indices rose 1.8 percent, 1.4 percent, and 0.6 percent, respectively. During the week, Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) increased their selling as they sold equities worth Rs 8,365.53 crore, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought equities worth Rs 19,351.62 crore. ""Amidst mixed signals from global peers, investor sentiment remained volatile, influenced by uncertainties surrounding pivotal policy decisions from major central banks. The unexpected interest rate hike by the BoJ after 17 years and the ECB's choice to maintain rates contributed to subdued market sentiment. However, the market rebounded following the Fed's indication to proceed with three interest rate cuts this year, despite inflation remaining above the long-term target,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. ""Mid & Smallcap could recover halve as buying improved led by continued DIIs & FIIs inflows. The IT sector faced headwinds driven by the global slowdown in spending. Investors redirected attention towards the realty sector, which emerged as the top performer of the week."" ""The bounce is expected to continue in the short-term as traders punt to buy when the market is trading at oversold territory. However, concerns persisted regarding inflated valuations in mid and small-cap stocks. And large caps are expected to outperform in the medium term,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index added nearly 2 percent with Manoj Vaibhav Gems N Jewellers, eMudhra, Vadilal Industries, Dhani Services, Gensol Engineering, Reliance Power, Sobha, The Anup Engineering, Reliance Infrastructure, Swan Energy, Praj Industries, Skipper, Jayaswal Neco Industries and Five-Star Business Finance added between 15-42 percent.  On the other hand, Tata Investment Corporation, M K Proteins, Jai Balaji Industries, PC Jeweller, Sanmit Infra, Gujarat Ambuja Exports and DB Realty lost 10-20 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities On Friday, Nifty witnessed two days of recovery following a doji formation on the daily chart, indicating a bullish reversal. Moreover, the Nifty has reclaimed the critical 55-day exponential moving average. However, Nifty needs to cross over 22,100 to witness a clear rally towards the all-time high of 22,525. Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas On the daily charts, we can observe that the index is in the process of retracing the fall it has witnessed from 22526 – 21710. The key retracement levels are placed at 22118 – 22214. The dip found buying interest at 21900 – 21880 where the 20-hour moving average was placed. The retracement process is still not complete and hence the rally can continue. The daily and hourly momentum indicators provide a divergent signal which can lead to consolidation. The range is likely to be 22,200–21,900. Stock-specific action is likely to continue during this period. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Next week being a truncated week and the derivatives' monthly expiry, we might see some volatility while Nifty is likely to consolidate at higher levels. Also, US GDP data, and other key economic data would keep investors busy.

This uptick in deposit performance has garnered positive attention from various international brokerages who are bullish on the private lender and see up to 34 percent upside in the stock from the last closing price. Overnight, HDFC Bank's US-listed shares rallied over 7 percent. The bank's American Depository Receipt (ADR) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) climbed to nearly $70.

Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Analysts at Macquarie believe that at the current valuation,HDFC Bankstock is attractive and investors should buy for a target of Rs 2,000. The brokerage has assigned an 'outperform' rating to the stock as it said that the robust Q4 update indicates that its consolidation strategy is playing out well. The deposit growth has pleasantly surprised, while the decline in corporate loan growth and Loan Deposit Ratio (LDR) are viewed as excellent outcomes by the brokerage. HDFC Bank valuations remain attractive, suggesting that it may be an opportune time to add the stock, Macquarie said.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/capital-goods-index-records-historic-outperformance-will-the-dream-run-continue-12559341.html,"The BSE Capital Goods index climbed unprecedented heights, outstripping the Sensex by a significant margin, in FY24. With an impressive 80 percent surge over the past year, the index has eclipsed the benchmark's 25 percent gain, marking the highest level of outperformance in 18 years. Keeping up a trend, the capital goods index recorded the longest streak of outperformance in FY24, when it raced ahead of the Sensex for the fourth consecutive year. Yet, in terms of actual rate of outperformance, last fiscal ranks second only to FY06, when the BSE Capital Goods index delivered an outperformance of 82 percent, clocking an annual return of 156 percent, higher than 74 percent for the BSE bellwether.  On April 2, the Capital Goods index hit a new all-time high of 62,370, with a gain of 0.65 percent. Heavyweight stocks like L&T played a pivotal role in driving this surge. Other prominent players in the league included BEL, Laxmi Machine Works, Carborandum Universal, Hindustan Aeronautics, Thermax, ABB India, and Siemens India. All of these scaled their fresh life highs on the day. Also read:Debt-free capital goods MNCs outperform Nifty on capex boosters Analysts attribute this remarkable performance to a confluence of factors. “The capital goods sector is firing on all cylinders,” Purvesh Shelatkar, head of institutional broking at Monarch Networth Capital, said. ""While government support, coupled with a resurgence in private capital expenditure, has laid a strong foundation for growth, improvements in capacity utilisation among manufacturing companies, and margin expansions across the capital goods segment, have propelled the profitability."" This dynamics is evident in the numbers. Earnings growth of the capital goods sector has outpaced that of the broader market. BSE-listed capital goods companies recorded a staggering 38 percent growth in earnings, far surpassing the 18 percent growth by Sensex companies in the past fiscal. Expectations of continued surge in earnings has led to a notable expansion in the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the BSE Capital Goods index, reflecting a rerating of stocks driven by solid fundamentals. The index is trading at a trailing P/E of 41x compared with Sensex’s 24x.  While healthy order books provide revenue visibility, enhanced supply chain efficiencies and robust balance sheets further bolster the sector's resilience, analysts said. However, there is a chance that stock prices may take a breather. “There could be some consolidation in stock prices in the first half of FY25 because of general elections. Otherwise, the demand side scenario remains robust and we should see the trend continuing,” Hemil Shah, Fund Manager, Torus ORO PMS, said. Shah believes capex will be good in coming year keeping stock on high growth trajectory. This view is echoed by other analysts who believe despite steep valuations, stocks may have more steam left in the medium-term. Avinash Kumar of LKP Securities highlighted the sector's immense growth potential, driven by a sizable total addressable market (TAM) and the prospect of improved export markets as factors that support high valuations beyond the near-terms earnings numbers. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have also shown confidence in industrials, adding buoyancy to stocks, he said. Shelatkar is particularly bullish on debt-free MNC capital goods companies like ABB, Siemens and Cummins which should ride the cyclical upturn and seem poised to deliver higher double digit, superior to that of Nifty companies.

The stock took beating in the past year, sharply underperforming other pharma stocks on the back of its two-year earnings downgrade cycle and margin decline to below pre-COVID levels. The stock has corrected 8 percent this year against a 12 percent jump in the BSE healthcare index. According to BoFA Securities, the correction in the counter not only factors in the company's weak margin performance but also stacks its risk reward better than other largecap players. BoFA has upgraded the stock to a “buy” from “underperform” and also raised the price target by 19 percent to Rs 4,025 a share. Buoyed by the ratings upgrade, ,Divi's Laboratoriessettled nearly 2 percent higher on the NSE on April 3. ""Likely bottoming of margin in near term and relative valuation provide an attractive entry point for Divi's Laboratories,"" BoFA said. ""We also see lower risk to the 35 percent earnings growth over FY25-26 with valuation for Divis at 35.5x FY26 P/E appearing more compelling as compared to large peers given uncertainty on US generic pricing, regulatory risks."" The end of destocking cycle and peer commentary suggests bottoming-out of margins in the near term, it said. BoFA expects margins to reach 33 percent by FY26, driven by factors such as the successful launch of generic active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and contributions from new drug master files (DMFs). Analysts also expect increased supplies of contrast media APIs and Good Laboratory Practice-1 intermediate supplies to play a role, along with the ramp-up of Kakinada post-commissioning. These improvements are projected to start contributing from the second half of FY25, leading to a 35 percent earnings CAGR with the full impact likely visible in FY26.

Earlier during the week, the stronger-than-expected PMI data had pulled the markets into red and the bond markets had surged. This had resulted in a weak investor sentiment, as worries of Federal Reserve’s rate cuts not coming in soon, troubled traders.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, he suggested exiting the segment due to the high allocation towards the PSE sector. Considering the high allocation towards PSE sector, he believes exiting the segment would make sense. Due to the rally in the recent past one year, ""we may experience market consolidation or sideways movement in the near term. But the fundamentally strong companies will bounce back from the corrections relatively unscathed,"" says Raghvendra Nath, who has more than 29 years of corporate experience. Do you think investors should book profits in PSU space after recent run up? The PSU stocks have seen an impeccable rally in the past 1 year with the PSE Index (public sector enterprise) rising over 100 percent in the same period. This rally was fuelled by the increasing order book in sectors such as railways and energy while the surge in PSU banks was seen due to an improvement in the balance sheet and healthy loan growth. These improvements in the PSE sector coupled with the low float of these companies has caused a euphoria making the stocks runway ahead from their fundamentals. However, continuing the same growth momentum would be a hurdle for these stocks as they have a knack for slow execution and poor governance. Historically, post elections we have also seen a slowdown in the order book which would cause more problems for the PSE segment. Coming onto the valuation point of view, the historical PE ratios of railway stocks has been in the range of 10-15 times while currently they are trading at a PE of 30-40 times, PSU banks which used to trade around a P/B ratio of 1 to 1.5 times have almost doubled to trade at a P/B ratio of 2-3 times. Energy & railway stocks have also seen their PE ratios increase by 20 percent-30 percent from their historical levels. Clearly these stocks have entered into the overvalued territory and it’s just a matter of time before the bubble would burst. Also read:Small, midcaps to outperform largecaps this year as economy pivots to manufacturing: Emkay The recent plummet in the markets saw the PSE index fall 10 percent in 5 days, showing signs of concerns in this segment. Considering the high allocation towards this sector, we believe exiting the segment would make sense as they have clearly forayed into a territory of extreme overvaluation. Is it the good time to bottom fish in the midcap IT space and stay with the same segment instead of largecap IT space? On macro level, largecaps are trading at relatively attractive valuation as compared to midcap IT space. But the IT companies in general have shown good returns in past 6 months. There are some opportunities in the space, but selective stock-picking will be preferred over betting on the sector. Do you surprise if the market sees sharp correction in coming weeks despite more tailwinds than less headwinds? We have seen some correction in past weeks in small and mid-cap index, and the space is likely to experience headwinds in coming days. This is again due to the caution from SEBI, and froth building up in the market. Due to the rally in the recent past one year, we may experience market consolidation or sideways movement in the near term. But the fundamentally strong companies will bounce back from the corrections relatively unscathed. Do you think the stress tests in AMC is one of key reasons for nervousness in the equity markets? We do see it being a key reason for the recent corrections in the markets along with other factors like tax loss harvesting, profit bookings and some caution due to the high valuations in the market. Specially with markets at such high valuations, the bourses are expected to be under stress. Also read:Mind the gap: the main lesson from MF stress tests But as we highlighted, the companies showing good numbers are likely to bounce back from such corrections in coming weeks. Do you still expect significant correction in SME and microcap stocks? We do see corrections happening in the SME and micro stocks, due to liquidity being sucked out on account of Mahadev betting app scam along with the ED being quite active in the space, which might shy some investors away. Certain rallies based on hearsay and market momentum are also to contribute to high valuations, and corrections in such stocks are imminent.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hot-stocks-why-you-should-bet-on-apollo-hospitals-and-eicher-motors-for-short-term-12519931.html,"Volatile trade ruled the market through the week ended March 22 with a slight positive note of 0.3 percent rise in Nifty at the time of settling down a tad below 22,100 levels. There has been a strong show of tug-of-war between the counterparties to exhibit their presence, though no conducive settlement was seen, portraying tentativeness in the market. The Nifty still hovers within the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving average (DEMA) on the daily chart, indicating uncertainty. However, the recent low signifies a lower low formation on the daily timeframe, and a further correction below the same could indicate the inception of a bearish trend in the markets. For now, 21,900-21,850 is likely to cushion any short-term blip, with major focus on a swing low of 21,700, breaching which disruption on chart structure could be seen in the current truncated week. On the higher end, 22,200-22,250 is expected to act as an intermediate hurdle, and an authoritative closure above the same could only bring some mojo back into the market. As we head for a truncated week with just three trading sessions and monthly expiry, it would be crucial to track global developments to have an immediate effect on the markets. Also, a spike in volatility is anticipated, keeping expiry in view. Hence, it is advisable to maintain caution and stay fussy with stock selection for an outperformance in the market. Here are three buy calls for the short term: Apollo Hospitals Enterprise: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,375.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,100 | Target: Rs 6,650-6,770 | Return: 6 percent Apollo Hospitals has witnessed a decent correction of over 13 percent in the recent period from the lifetime high zone, retracting towards the neckline of the breakout on the weekly time frame. After a couple of weeks of consolidation, the stock has regained strength and reverted towards the primary trend on the back of notable volumes, indicating an opportunity to go long. The technical indicators are very much in line with the bullish development, adding a strong undertone to the counter. Hence, we recommend buying Apollo Hospitals around Rs 6,370-6,350, with a stop-loss of Rs 6,100 and target of Rs 6,650-6,770. Eicher Motors: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,988.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,800 | Target: Rs 4,180-4,200 | Return: 5 percent Eicher Motors witnessed a strong spurt in price-volume in the last trading week from the cluster of its significant EMAs and made a strong runaway gap. Also, on the daily time frame, the counter has witnessed a sloping trendline breakout and made a strong weekly closure above its immediate swing high. From a technical standpoint, the 14-period RSI (relative strength index) and MACD (moving average convergence divergence) both signal a positive crossover, suggesting the counter looks poised to reclaim its lifetime high zone in a comparable period. Hence, we recommend buying Eicher Motors around Rs 3,970-3,950, with a stop-loss of Rs 3,800 and target of Rs 4,180-4,200.

While the Nifty 50 index saw a modest loss of nearly 2 percent over the week, the Nifty Smallcap 250 index faced a substantial correction of 6 percent, and the Nifty Midcap 150 index declined by over 4 percent. Despite this market turmoil, some relief emerged as the Nifty 50 managed to close above the crucial 22,000 mark. Earlier discussions centred around the 22,500 mark, representing the 100 percent extension of a previous move. As anticipated, a corrective move ensued from that level, leading to a trendline breakdown in the Nifty 50. However, this breakdown would only be invalidated if the index closes above 22,200. On the downside, 21,850 stands as a crucial support level, and breaching it might push the index towards the 21,600 level. Turning to the Nifty Smallcap 250 index, it has already corrected over 50 percent of the rally that commenced in October 2023. Additionally, a bullish harmonic pattern resulted in a sharp bounce during Thursday's trading session. Meanwhile, the Nifty Midcap 150 index retested its 100-day exponential moving average (DEMA) before witnessing a notable rebound. Looking ahead, while there might be another shake-off in the market in the near term, investors could view this as an opportunity to initiate fresh long positions. It is anticipated that the market uncertainty will likely dissipate by the end of the month, allowing the markets to resume their primary upward trend. On a different note, the Nifty Bank corrected approximately 3 percent during the last week, closing near the 46,500 mark. Currently, it rests on falling trendline support, which would be breached below the 46,000 level. Thus, for the upcoming week, 46,000 remains a critical support level for the index. A sustained hold above this level could pave the way for a recovery, with a move beyond 47,000 potentially reigniting bullish momentum. Here are three buy calls for next 3-4 weeks: ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 419 | Stop-Loss: Rs 390 | Target: Rs 475 | Return: 13 percent After reaching a peak near Rs 475 mark on January 4, 2024, ITC has experienced a significant decline of 16 percent. However, in the subsequent 18 trading sessions, ITC has shown stability by avoiding further declines and has instead consolidated within a range of Rs 400-416. Notably, in the previous trading session, there was notable buying interest observed at lower levels, accompanied by substantial trading volume. From a technical standpoint, the formation of a bullish AB=CD pattern on the daily chart of ITC within the mentioned price zone of Rs 400-416. Interestingly, this zone also coincides with the 0.382 percent retracement level of a price swing that occurred between January 2023 and July 2023, as indicated on the chart. Additionally, it has formed complex structure forming on the daily RSI indicator, resembling a 'W shape' below the 30 level, which suggests a potentially lucrative buying opportunity. Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 415-425 with an upside target of Rs 475 and a stop-loss would be placed near Rs 390 on a daily close basis.  Britannia Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,974 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,790 | Target: Rs 5,250 | Return: 5.5 percent Following a peak near Rs 5,386 level, Britannia experienced a significant decline of almost 11 percent in its value. However, over the past couple of months, Britannia has stabilized around Rs 4,800 levels, forming a prolonged support base. Notably, this level coincides with the 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA) and represents a 50 percent retracement of its previous upward movement from November 2023 to December 2023, as depicted in the provided chart. Additionally, a bullish AB=CD pattern has emerged near Rs 4,800 level, further confirming positive market sentiment.

The resistance zone is placed at 22,700-22,750, while support is at 22,600. A decisive move above 22,750 might induce a rally towards 23,000 in the short term.

The Bank Nifty index remained in consolidation mode at elevated levels, struggling to close above the 49,000 mark. Immediate support rests at 48,500, with resistance at 49,000. Any decisive move beyond these levels is expected to trigger trending moves, he said, adding the index maintains a buy-on-dip stance, with 48,500 acting as a crucial support level to cushion against any downturns.

The low of previous day around 21,950 and 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) placed around 21,860 are support levels for the immediate term as breaking these levels may drag it down towards 21,700 again, but in case of further recovery, 22,100-22,200 are immediate levels to track on the higher side, experts said. On March 21, the BSE Sensex rallied 540 points to 72,641, while the Nifty 50 climbed 173 points to 22,012 and formed a small-bodied bullish candlestick pattern with upper and lower shadow on the daily timeframe.

It is witnessing a steady recovery from the lower levels. The up move in the counter along with decent volume activity near support zone indicates that the downside is restricted. Unless it is trading below Rs 430, positional traders can retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 480.  National Aluminium Company On the daily charts, the counter was into a rangebound mode from the past few sessions. Eventually, it has given the range breakout and it has formed higher bottom formation. Therefore, the closing above the resistance line indicates further bullish momentum to continue from the current levels. For the trend following traders, Rs 140 would act as support level. Above the same, it could move up to Rs 155 levels.  BHEL After the short-term correction in the counter from the higher levels, the downward momentum has taken a pause. On the daily charts, the counter has formed a rounding bottom chart formation along with decent volume activity and it has reversed its trend from its support zone. The formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels. For the traders, Rs 230 would be the key support level to watch out. Above which the uptrend structure should continue until Rs 255.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rbi-mpc-experts-list-top-10-rate-sensitive-stocks-as-rbi-keeps-repo-unchanged-12581221.html,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent for the seventh time in a row on April 5. This was on expected lines as most economists and market experts feel the interest rate cut is likely to start only after similar action by the US Federal Reserve. The US central bank indicated three rate cuts this year with experts expecting the first one around end of June or early second half of 2024. The Reserve Bank of India also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target of 4 percent within a band of +/- 2 percent, while supporting growth. The domestic economy sees a strong momentum with growth in FY25 pegged at 7 percent with Q1FY25 at 7.1 percent, while the global economy showed resilience and is likely to maintain a steady growth in 2024, the RBI said. With the hope of normal monsoon this year and continuing food price uncertainties along with rising oil prices (Brent crude futures traded at $91 a barrel, up 11 percent in last one month), geo-political tensions and volatility in financial markets, the central bank expects the CPI inflation at 4.9 percent in Q1FY25 and 3.8 percent in Q2FY25, while the last reading was 5.1 percent in January-February (softening from 5.7 percent in December 2023) and core inflation at 3.3 percent in February as against 3.6 percent in January. ""Projections of real GDP growth for FY24-25 at 7 percent and CPI inflation at 4.5 percent for the year along with strong manufacturing and services PMI numbers and healthy corporate and banking balance sheet instills confidence of the resilience of Indian economy,"" Raghvendra Nath, MD at Ladderup Wealth Management said, adding if rural demand strengthens and there are no adverse surprises in inflation from food or crude oil prices, private consumption is expected to rise, further aiding the growth trajectory. However, he feels the timing and extent of rate cuts remain dependent on announcement by global central banks and the CPI aligning with RBI’s 4 percent target on a sustained basis. The market turned volatile around 22,500 on the Nifty 50 as it seems to have priced in the non-event. Now, the all focus will be on the corporate earnings that will start next week, and in case the index gives a strong close above 22,600, then the further march towards 22,700-22,800 area is likely on cards, with support at 22,300, experts said. ""The RBI MPC meet has become a non-event for the market as everything was on expected lines with no new surprises,"" Sheersham Gupta, director and senior technical analyst at Rupeezy, said. He maintained a mild bullish stance for the Nifty, especially the financials, for the short to medium term. On the upside, the immediate resistance for the Nifty stands at 22,600 and, if surpassed, the index may potentially reach levels around 22,750, he feels. The rate-sensitive stocks were mixed with the Bank Nifty rising 0.4 percent and Realty index jumping 1.5 percent, but Auto was down third of a percent at the time of writing this article. Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 rate sensitive stocks from experts with a 3-4-week perspective. The stock price of April 4 is considered for the calculation of returns: Expert: Jigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,527.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,465 | Target: Rs 1,620 | Return: 6 percent Recently, HDFC Bank experienced a significant upward movement following a period of consolidation between Rs 1,400 and Rs 1,475 and is now trading above Rs 1,530. Moreover, the daily stochastic indicator has shown a bullish reversal from just above the oversold threshold of 25, indicating positive momentum. This breakout is further supported by substantial trading volume. Additionally, the stock closed above the weekly R5 resistance camarilla Pivot (Rs 1,487.9), suggesting continued bullish sentiment. Consequently, we recommend traders/investors to consider buying within Rs 1,500-1,530 range, targeting Rs 1,620, with a stop-loss placed near Rs 1,465 on a daily closing basis.  AU Small Finance Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 621 | Stop-Loss: Rs 568 | Target: Rs 720 | Return: 16 percent AU Small Finance Bank reached a peak around Rs 813 on January 8, 2024, but then experienced a decline of approximately 32 percent. However, in the past two weeks, the stock has shown a significant recovery and is currently trading near Rs 620 mark, indicating a bullish sentiment. On the indicator side, the weekly Scale Stochastics indicator has identified a ""hidden Bull Divergence"" close to its previous low point recorded on March 20, 2023 (as shown on the chart). This divergence suggests the possibility of upward momentum and indicates a potential bullish sentiment. Therefore, investors may consider adding long positions in the range of Rs 600-625, with an upside target set at Rs 720. It's recommended to set a stop-loss near Rs 568 on a daily closing basis to manage risk.  Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,063 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,025 | Target: Rs 1,130 | Return: 6 percent Since peaking around Rs 1,130 mark on March 6, 2024, Axis Bank has undergone a significant downturn, experiencing a notable decline of approximately 9 percent. However, in the following six trading sessions, Axis Bank has shown resilience, avoiding further declines and instead consolidating within a range spanning from Rs 1,040 to Rs 1,080. Interestingly, support is also evident near Rs 1,050 levels due to Fibonacci ratio clustering, and daily stochastics indicate a ""hidden Bull Divergence,"" adding to the bullish sentiment in the stock (refer to the chart). Therefore, investors may contemplate adding long positions within Rs 1,050-1,070 range, with an upside target set at Rs 1,130. To manage risk, it is advisable to set a stop-loss near Rs 1,025 on a daily closing basis.  Expert: Ashish Kyal, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Canara Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 607 | Stop-Loss: Rs 550 | Target: Rs 670 | Return: 10 percent As shown on the below chart, Canara Bank have shown an excellent rise and prices are moving precisely within the upward sloping channel. We have identified the 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) which has successfully supported rallies in the past and dips towards this average have acted as a great buying opportunity as major lows have formed near this average. So as long as price holds above it, the trend is likely to remain bullish. Support as per this is near Rs 550 levels. Along with this, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has also shown bullish crossover which is acting as a double confirmation. However, looking at the overall rise, buy on dips looks prudent strategy for better risk reward for the target of Rs 670 which is also a channel resistance as long as Rs 550 holds on the downside.  Godrej Properties: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,410 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,195 | Target: Rs 3,150 | Return: 31 percent In the previous session, Godrej Properties closed on a flat note. Stock is currently facing hurdle near previous swing high which is near Rs 2,540 levels. A decisive breakout above it can result into fresh rise in this stock. Stock is following classic Elliott wave theory. Wherein, currently wave 5 of primary wave (3) is moving on the upside. As per guidelines wave 3 is considered as a strongest one. So further rise is expected in this stock once it breaches above Rs 2,540 level for the target of Rs 3,150 levels or higher. Key support is at Rs 2,195 levels. LIC Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 644 | Stop-Loss: Rs 610 | Target: Rs 725 | Return: 13 percent LIC Housing Finance is currently trading at important juncture. In previous session, there is minor rejection from the highs. Now acceptance back above Rs 661 followed by Rs 670 will indicate a strong positive breakout which will open the targets for Rs 725 levels. Since March 21 not a single candle has given closed below previous day's low which keeps overall tone on the positive side. ADX (average directional index) is showing readings of 27 suggesting that momentum is picking up. So, a breach above Rs 670 resistance level is must for further bullish momentum to continue with the target of Rs 725 level as long as Rs 610 holds on the downside.  Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, HOD - Research at GEPL Capital City Union Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 154 | Stop-Loss: Rs 143 | Target: Rs 177 | Return: 15 percent The City Union Bank weekly chart reveals a consolidation phase, with recent indications of a turnaround from a support zone, potentially marking a sustained reversal. This reversal is supported by increased volume participation, evident from the surge above the crucial 21-week average. On the daily scale, the stock is establishing higher highs and higher lows, delineating a short-term uptrend that aligns with the broader timeframe. Furthermore, City Union Bank is currently maintaining levels above key moving averages such as the 12-week and 26-week EMAs, signaling a trend improvement. The RSI above 60 and bullish crossovers further underscore the positive momentum. Looking ahead, it's reasonable to anticipate continued upward movement in the stock, with a potential target price of Rs 177. It's advisable to set a stop-loss at Rs 143 on a closing basis to manage risk effectively.  Jana Small Finance Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 467 | Stop-Loss: Rs 430 | Target: Rs 542 | Return: 16 percent JSFB (Jana Small Finance Bank) is displaying a consistent pattern of higher highs and higher lows on the daily scale, indicating strong momentum and forming an IPO base as it approaches its all-time high. Following a reversal candlestick on the weekly scale, the stock experienced a significant turnaround, reflecting positive sentiment and maintaining levels above the 12-day exponential moving average, signifying an improvement in trend. Moreover, on the weekly timeframe, JSFB has demonstrated rapid retracement, with a four-week downtrend (from Rs 466 to Rs 368) being reversed in just two weeks, underscoring robust price action and signaling a potential upward trajectory. Looking ahead, it is reasonable to anticipate that the upward movement will continue, potentially reaching Rs 542 level. It is advisable to set a stop-loss at Rs 430 on a closing basis to manage risk. State Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 759 | Stop-Loss: Rs 700 | Target: Rs 900 | Return: 19 percent Since June 2020, SBI has demonstrated a strong price structure characterized by a rising trend. On the monthly scale, bullish price action has been evident, with the stock forming a Rally Base Rally pattern. Notably, in the prior month, a Doji candlestick has formed, suggesting a base, and indicating a potential rally ahead according to this price action pattern. On the weekly scale, February 2024 have shown polarity followed by impulse momentum, signaling a continuation of the upward trajectory. SBI has consistently traded above important averages such as the 12-week and 26-week moving averages, indicating a positive trend. Additionally, the MACD study shows increasing values in the positive territory, further reinforcing the bullish momentum. Furthermore, on the ratio chart of SBI against Nifty, polarity observed from the 2022 swing indicates a continuation of its outperformance. Going ahead, we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 900. The bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 700 level. Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, senior technical research analyst at HDFC Securities HUDCO: Buy | LTP: Rs 207 | Stop-Loss: Rs 193 | Target: Rs 230 | Return: 11 percent The weekly timeframe chart of this Housing & Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) indicates sharp upside bounce so far this week. After shifting in to a downward correction amidst larger range movement in the last couple of months, the stock price is currently in an attempt of decisive upside breakout of the said range around Rs 202-205 levels. The stock price on the smaller timeframe has moved above the hurdle of down sloping trend line around Rs 198-200 levels. The volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) shows positive indication. Buying can be initiated in HUDCO at CMP (Rs 207.15), add more on dips down to Rs 200, wait for the upside target of Rs 230 in the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stoploss of Rs 193.  Indiabulls Real Estate: Buy | LTP: Rs 135.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 125 | Target: Rs 149 | Return: 10 percent After showing a downward correction with high volatility in the last 5-6 weeks, the real estate stock - Indiabulls Real Estate - has witnessed a sharp upmove so far this week. The bullish chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms is intact as per weekly timeframe chart and present upmove in the stock price could be in line with new higher top of the sequence. Weekly 10 and 20 period EMAs (exponential moving average) are intact and they have been offering supports during minor dips in the stock price over the period of time. Weekly 14 period RSI has turned up above crucial upper 60 levels and the volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price. This is positive indication and signal more upside for the stock price in the near term. One may look to buy Indiabulls Real Estate at CMP (Rs 135.55), add more on dips down to Rs 129 and wait for the upside target of Rs 149 in the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 125.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ramesh-damani-spells-out-3-ds-of-indian-markets-bull-run-says-best-time-to-invest-is-now-12501411.html,"Demographics of an aspirational population, domestic consumption, and transformative impact of digitisation are the major forces fuelling Indian equity markets’ bull run, said veteran investor and BSE member Ramesh Damani. In an interview toMoneycontrolon the sidelines of News18 Rising Bharat Summit, Damani expressed optimism about the long-term growth of the Indian markets, highlighting a historical compounding rate of 14-15 percent. He said that investors can expect significant returns, akin to the transformation seen in Japan from 1964 onwards.Edited excerpts of the interview: Follow our live blog for all the market action You said that India’s bull run is being fuelled by the domestic consumption story. Is the consumption strong all across, or is it strong at the premium end but weak at the lower end? The markets are about looking into the future, and not at the past. While there was a K-shape recovery post-Covid, India’s demographics and digitisation that's taking place will act as huge levellers. Also read:PSU stocks will continue to lead the market rally, says ace investor Ramesh Damani Demographics are changing a lot of things. India is now the most populous nation. The growth and the prosperity will come from our people and our workforce out there. The second part is the impact of digitisation in India. People can now pay frictionless for something by digitisation, and get services that only the wealthy got, whether it's your demat accounts, broking accounts, regular interface, or the job profile that you have. Read more:Rising Bharat Summit 2024: How India's bull case looks to top market investors So we hope that the K-shape recovery becomes more inclusive and more prosperous over the next 5-10 years. You talk about digitisation being a pillar of growth. Can you explain? Digitisation creates a paradigm shift in terms of opportunities for all Indians. For example, thanks to digitisation, people will be able to do a lot more back office work which cannot be done in America. And, they'll be doing it in Banaras, or Coimbatore, or Lucknow, or other such places across India, which will of course create a huge multiplier effect. I think this revolution will not take place in the next three months or the next two quarters, but over the next 10-20 years. That long-term equity markets will do well in India is a given. What could be the short-term pain points? The people who have made money in India are the long term investors. When I started my career in the stock market prior to 1990, the index was below 1,000. Today it's 75,000. So it paid to be a long term investor in India. In that time, there have been various falls, the global financial crisis, governments have come and gone, Kargil (war). And yet, 30-35 years later, the index has compounded at 14-15 percent. I think short-term, there's always risk, there's always volatility that goes on. There’s a winter squall. It’ll destroy a few things. But the people who really prosper are the people who buy good companies. The sheer power of compounding makes you rich in this business. Markets are volatile right now. Would you advice investors to wait for better entry points? It’s almost very difficult to say. But like I said, the best time to invest in India was in July 1991 before Manmohan Singh announced his economic liberalisation program. The next best time to do it is today. I don't feel it's too late to invest in India. Remember if your money doubles every three years, you're going to be enormously rich. The index itself will give you 16-17 percent, plus a couple of points for dividend. So a 5-10 percent correction doesn't mean anything if you are a long term investor. As I mentioned,  India is looking where Japan was in 1964. The index went from 1,000 to 40,000, and all the Japanese companies became global household names. What was your reading on Q3 earnings? I look at my own individual companies’ earnings, and they could have been better, but I think we are broadly on track and doing well. I had a lot of exposure to the public sector companies whose earnings trajectory has been very good. A lot of these private sector FMCG companies or banks haven't done that well because the earnings have disappointed. For the companies or sectors that you hold, what kind of earnings are you looking forward to? Generally, we have companies with 18-20 percent earnings out there. I have a very diversified basket of portfolios. I can't individually say which one is going to do well. Sometimes they come as a surprise to us also. In terms of companies’ business performance in Q4, where do you see raw material pressures, and where do you see pricing power?

On the hourly chart, it appears that the Index is forming an inverted head & shoulder formation where a level of 22,200 will be considered as a breakout point (neckline), and in that case, the target is 22,640.

If the index closes and stays above this level for few sessions, then record highs can't be ruled in the coming sessions with support at the 21,900 level, experts said, adding that till then consolidation may rule the market. On March 27, the benchmark indices recovered all the previous day's losses and closed higher. The Nifty 50 jumped 119 points to 22,124, and the BSE Sensex was up 526 points at 72,996, while the Nifty Midcap 100 index gained 0.06 percent and Smallcap 100 index rose nearly 1 percent. Stocks that performed much better than the benchmarks as well as broader markets included ABB India, Maruti Suzuki, and Info Edge India.ABB Indiahad a gap-up opening and ended at fresh record closing high of Rs 6,279, up 5.9 percent. The stock has formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with healthy volumes, and traded above all key moving averages, which is a positive sign. Maruti Suzuki India, too, ended at new closing high of Rs 12,510, up 2.12 percent and formed bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe with above average volumes. The stock remained above all key moving averages since last week. Info Edge Indiahas seen a decisive breakout of consolidation seen for several weeks and recorded 5 percent rally to Rs 5,476. The stock has formed robust bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with significantly higher volumes, while the stock climbed above all key moving averages. Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: ABB India In the recent trading session, ABB India exhibited a significant breakout above the R4 camarilla pivot (Rs 6,111), maintaining its position above this level. Additionally, daily stochastics have ventured into the overbought territory, suggesting a bullish momentum anticipated in the upcoming days. The combination of price action persisting above the R4 camarilla pivot and stochastics registering as overbought presents a compelling technical confluence, reinforcing the bullish sentiment surrounding ABB India. Consequently, investors may consider initiating a buy position within the range of Rs 6,200-6,300, targeting an upside potential of Rs 6,965, while prudently placing a stop-loss near Rs 5,900 based on daily closing prices. Info Edge India During the recent trading session, Info Edge India experienced a notable surge, garnering attention from investors and traders. However, amidst this intraday upswing, the stock encountered a significant barrier around Rs 5,550 mark, leading to a subsequent pullback. Interestingly, this level aligns with Info Edge's previous peak recorded on February 12, 2024. Moreover, it coincides with the R4 camarilla resistance zone (Rs 5,550), indicating a formidable obstacle at present. Given these observations, traders and investors are cautioned against initiating long positions and are advised to exercise patience, awaiting meaningful corrections before considering any further actions.  Maruti Suzuki India On March 22, Maruti demonstrated a noteworthy breakthrough above the R4 camarilla pivot (Rs 12,122), as indicated in the chart, and has since maintained its position above this level, currently hovering near Rs 12,500 mark. Furthermore, daily stochastics have entered the overbought zone, implying a bullish momentum expected in the forthcoming days. This alignment of price action persisting above the R4 camarilla pivot alongside stochastics indicating overbought conditions presents a compelling technical confluence, underscoring the bullish sentiment surrounding Maruti. As a result, investors might contemplate initiating a buy position within the range of Rs 12,400-12,500, with a target upside potential of Rs 13,000. It is advisable to exercise caution by prudently placing a stop-loss near Rs 12,100 based on daily closing prices.

Taking Stock: Sensex, Nifty close at new highs, all eyes on RBI policy The Sensex and Nifty also hit fresh all-time highs of 74,501.73 and 22,619 early in the day but pared some of the gains as the session progressed... Read More The Nifty opened gap up and witnessed selling pressure during the first half of the trading session. An equally sharp pullback during the second half helped the index close with gains of ~80 points. The Nifty is heading towards the upper end of the rising channel placed at 22700. On the downside the zone of 22350 – 22300 shall act as a crucial support from short term perspective. Minor degree pullbacks towards support zones should be used as a buying opportunity.Bank Nifty is also inching higher towards 48500 – 48636 zone which is the All Time High. Momentum indicators on the daily and hourly time frame suggest continuation of the upmove. The zone of 47700 – 47500 shall act as a crucial support zone from short term perspective. Hero MotoCorp has received the orders / notices pertaining to six assessment years, amounting to a tax demand of Rs 308.65 crore and interest thereon of Rs 296.22 crore. This is on account of certain disallowances, for the assessment years 2013-14 to 2017- 18 and 2019-20. On April 4, Indian benchmark indices concluded higher amidst volatile trading, with the Nifty surpassing the 22,500 mark. At the close, the Sensex recorded a gain of 350.81 points or 0.47 percent, reaching 74,227.63, while the Nifty climbed by 80.00 points or 0.36 percent, settling at 22,514.70. Analysis of the Nifty on the daily chart indicates a recent breakout of a rounding bottom pattern with significant volume. However, the formation of a hanging man candlestick pattern at all-time high levels suggests a potential reversal. Nevertheless, if the index manages to close above the 22,600 level, it could extend its upward movement towards 22,800 and 23,000 in the forthcoming days. On the downside, immediate support levels are seen at 22,300 and 22,200. Examining the Open Interest (OI) data, the highest OI on the call side is observed at the 22,800 strike price, followed by the 23,000 strike price. Conversely, the highest OI on the put side is seen at the 22,300 strike price. Gold continue to hover around its all-time high levels, on the back of weakness in the Dollar amid uncertainty over U.S. interest rate cuts, while increased safe haven demand also aided prices. Following Gold's footsteps, Silver too marked an all-time high on domestic front, amidst a sharp rally in industrial metals. Persistent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine, coupled with a devastating earthquake in Taiwan, spurred safe haven plays into bullion and other precious metals. Fed Governor and officials’ comments remain mixed regarding the pace of interest rate cuts in this year. Governor Powell in his comments yesterday mentioned that the interest rates have peaked for this cycle, however they will still watch the economic numbers and inflation trend before taking any decision. Governor Powell believes that the monetary policy is tight. Economic data points from the US are also reported a bit mixed, but no major impact is being seen on the metal prices. US factory orders and ADP employment change were reported better than expectations, while US JOLTS and Services PMI were reported better than expectations. Dollar index fell from their recent peak of 105 to 104.20, however US 10Y yields are higher hovering above 4.3% mark. Focus now shifts to comments from several Fed officials who could prepare us for US central bank’s monetary policy path ahead. The nonfarm payrolls data scheduled later this week is very important to watch for as, sticky inflation and strength in the labor market are the two biggest considerations for the Fed in altering interest rates this year. gMarkets traded volatile for yet another session and gained nearly half a percent. After the initial uptick, Nifty slipped sharply lower in the early hours however strength in heavyweights, especially from banking and IT majors, helped the index to recoup losses and inch higher. Eventually, Nifty settled at 22,514.65 level; up by 0.4%. Meanwhile, a mixed trend continued on the sectoral front wherein FMCG and energy closed in the red. The buoyancy continued on the broader front wherein smallcap gained nearly half a percent. We expect the prevailing tone to continue however the pace of advance would largely depend upon the performance of banking and IT majors. Participants should continue with the “buy on dips” approach and focus more on stock selection. The Nifty remained highly volatile as the index fluctuated within the range of 22,300 and 22,600 throughout the day. On the daily chart, the index has formed a hanging man pattern, indicating a potential bearish reversal in the short term. Immediate support is positioned at 22,300; a decisive drop below this level could lead the index towards 22,000-21,900 in the short term. On the upside, resistance is observed at 22,600-22,650. Market breadth displayed a positive trend within a narrow trading range, with attention focused on the RBI's upcoming monetary policy announcement tomorrow. Expectations lean towards the likely status quo in the repo rate due to prevalent inflation worries. Meanwhile, the broader market has shown resilience in select sectors like banks in anticipation of decent Q4 results and exports based on composite PMI data reflecting strong business conditions. Gains in frontline IT and private banking stocks buoyed Sensex & Nifty to fresh record highs in a highly volatile session. Despite the recovery, volatility may still persist due to renewed uptick in US bond yields on fading hopes of a rate cut over next few months. This will continue to weigh on Indian markets too, and along with FII selling pressure, local equities may continue to face the heat. Following a strong resurgence, the Bank Nifty surged past the significant resistance level of 48,000, coinciding with the peak open interest on the call side. The immediate support for the index has now shifted to 47,500, where the highest open interest is concentrated on the put side. Post the RBI policy announcement, sustaining above the 48,000 level is crucial for the continuation of the uptrend towards the 49,000/50,000 levels. Extreme volatility was seen in today's trade as the Index started the session at the record level of 22,600 but higher levels did not last for long and a steep fall was seen across the board. Selected IT and Banking counters guided the Index for recovery to end the session higher at 22,514.65 with gains of 80 points. Disparity was seen in the Broader markets where Midcaps marginally underperformed while Smallcaps performed in line with the Frontline Index. The Index has made a Hanging Man candlestick pattern at the record levels which is generally considered a reversal pattern but a firm close above 22,600 will negate the implications of the bearish candle while a level of 22,300 will continue to act as a strong base.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/four-investment-bets-from-a-fund-manager-who-delivered-93-return-over-the-past-year-12607781.html,"He may be a lesser-known investment manager, but his track record over the past year certainly demonstrates a winning streak. Based in Gurugram, Siddharth Oberoi of Prudent Equity AIF manages a Category III Alternate Investment Fund. Since its inception in December 2022, his fund has yielded a return of 62.94 percent compared to its benchmark S&P 500 at 20.85 percent. In the last year alone, the fund has delivered a return of 93 percent compared to the benchmark of 38 percent. He spoke exclusively to Moneycontrol about his top investment picks. Home finance – Proxy for real estate surgeOberoi suggests investors play the real estate theme through housing finance companies rather than directly because valuations of real estate companies have skyrocketed and are now fully valued. The Nifty Realty Index has a trailing PE of 61.5x as of April 8, which was 38.2x a year ago.  On the contrary, housing finance companies are being overlooked and are undervalued, he notes. “Almost 90 percent of real estate purchases are financed and currently the demand for real estate is strong, so the outlook for housing finance companies appears bright,” Oberoi says. ""The demand is so strong that 80 percent of the flats in a new project get booked on the first day itself."" The best way to benefit from this surge in demand, which he feels is largely restricted to the luxury segment, is through housing financiers. Housing finance companies contribute 15 percent to the overall fund's portfolio. Broadcast companies: Bet on election splurgeHis views on the broadcasting sector are positive in the short term and negative in the long run. Oberoi believes that advertising revenues of broadcasting companies may surge due to the election season, making it a good bet in the short term. However, he believes these are not good long-term investment bets due to intense competition in the sector and unappealing growth prospects. Also read :Media stocks soar amid election advertisement spending boom Time Technoplast: Undervalued growthThe fund manager is currently bullish on Time Technoplast and Welspun Enterprises. He purchased Time Technoplast shares when the company announced its plan to become debt-free and distribute the leftover from overseas business to its shareholders. ""Now the company is paying off its debt by selling low-margin and low-ROE businesses,"" said Oberoi. Time Technoplast is a well-diversified company with multiple verticals and plans to focus on their India business and selling the overseas one. The retained vertical is also higher margin one and will make the company more capital efficient. Plus it is highly undervalued for a company growing at 15 percent annually. Welspun Enterprises: Cash is comfortOberoi likes Welspun Enterprises because it has a lot of cash on its books and extremely low debt. The company is also very selective in taking projects. It does not take projects until a certain margin requirement is met. It has also monetized all its assets. Also, it has an order book of Rs 14,000 crore, executable over the next three years. Also, the company is trading at single digit P/E multiples. Oberoi’s investment thesis focuses on individual businesses and their growth prospects rather than the macro story. He also prefers buying stocks in special situations like buybacks or open offers. The fund manager says, ""A company doing a series of buybacks suggests that it has a good capital allocation policy, especially when done at a cheap price. Buybacks are a significant trigger for stock prices as it means that the company is sucking out liquidity from the market, plus it is EPS (earnings per share) accretive.""

The Sensex was down 58.80 points or 0.08 percent at 74,683.70, and the Nifty was down 24.50 points or 0.11 percent at 22,641.80.

""We expect markets to take a pause or consolidate before taking a direction based on the earnings in the next 20 days,"" he said. If the earnings season disappoints, the market will correct. If upgrades outnumber downgrades, the market will continue to move upwards, Kulkarni said. ALSO READ:Nifty Metal index climbs 2% amid revival in global manufacturing activity On the other hand, V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services believes that this pattern of 'higher highs and higher lows' is a distinct bullish signal and this has been a standout pattern in the Indian market this year. However, he pointed out that in this richly valued market, there is valuation comfort in largecap banking stocks. ""We expect Q4 results of the banking majors to be very good. Sectors like capital goods, autos, cement and hospitality are also likely to remain resilient,"" he noted. Broader markets, too, erased earlier gains and slipped in red on April 9. The BSE Smallcap and BSE Midcap indices declined up to 0.4 percent. India VIX, which measures near-term volatility eased by over 2 percent to settle around 11.3. Sectorally, Nifty Metal index was the performer led by gains in Tata Steel, Hindustan Zinc, Hindalco, and Vedanta. The positive movement comes amid firming up of commodity prices and revival in global manufacturing activity data. Last week, the US saw its manufacturing sector growing for the first time in 18 months. Similarly, China's manufacturing activity expanded in March for the first time since September, indicating economic stabilisation in the world's second-largest economy. Additionally, Nifty Realty index also fared well driven by gains in Godrej Properties. Godrej Properties clocked the highest-ever quarterly sales in Q4FY24, registering 135 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth. On the flipside, Nifty PSU Bank and Nifty FMCG indices were the top sectoral underperformers on April 9. From an investment standpoint, market experts suggested to buy-every-dip as India Inc begins its fourth quarter corporate earnings season. TCS will kick off earnings season on April 12, followed by Bajaj Auto, HDFC Life, and Infosys on April 18.

It closed marginally in the red down ~9 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty is in the process of cooling off after the sharp run-up in the previous couple of trading sessions. The zone of 22400 – 22350 is the crucial support zone and dips towards these zones should be used as a buying opportunity. The hourly momentum indicator has a negative crossover which is a sell signal and also suggests that there could be some more consolidation before the uptrend resumes. Overall, this dip should be used a buying opportunity. Bank Nifty is also consolidating after breaking out of the range on the upside. It is likely to resume its up-move towards 47850 – 48000 from a short-term perspective. So the minor degree pullbacks should be used as a buying opportunity. The Bank Nifty index maintained a narrow consolidation pattern in anticipation of the RBI policy. With downside support at 47000 and upside resistance at 48000, a breakout in either direction could trigger significant market moves. Despite the consolidation, the overall sentiment remains bullish, suggesting that dips should be seen as buying opportunities, especially with immediate support around the 47400-47350 zone.

Investors are eagerly anticipating guidance from the upcoming RBI monetary policy announcement for insight into near-term market direction. Markets witnessed select profit taking in banking and IT stocks as caution prevailed throughout the session ahead of the RBI monetary policy decision on Friday. Rising US bond yields have led to FIIs fleeing Indian equities in recent sessions.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hot-us-inflation-kills-hopes-of-rate-cut-in-june-may-halt-india-share-market-rally-12617481.html,"Higher-than-expected US retail inflation for March has delayed expectations of the Fed interest rate cuts to beyond June, sending equity markets in a tailspin, and bond yields soaring. A rate cut in June now looks unlikely, said experts. TheUS consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4 percent month-on-month in March, maintaining the same pace as in February. On an year-on-year basis, March CPI inflation was at 3.5 percent, accelerating from 3.2 percent year-on-year in February. Both month-on-month and year-on-year readings beat Reuters poll estimates. Further, core inflation too remained hot, coming in at 0.4 percent month-on-month, and at 3.8 percent year-on-year. Stocks fell. S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average --all tumbled about 1 percent or more. Gift Nifty on IFSC fell 0.6 percent, or 130 points to 22,629 at 8.40 pm IST, after the NSE Nifty 50 made a record high in intraday trading earlier. Is the US Fed rate cut completely off the table for now? ""This is the 3rd successive 'hot' CPI print, and has completely shaken expectations of both the extent and the timing of rate cuts in 2024. We continue to maintain that the Fed will not cut rates this year, on the back of hotter inflation and slowing-yet-stable growth,"" said Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services. The inflation reading may have also reduced the expectations of the number of rate cuts. “With this, the probability of a June cut (<20 percent) is minimal. Even July rate cut probability (45 percent) is less than even, with the first cut expectation being pushed to September meeting. This also means that the market now expects 2 cuts by year end instead of 3, said Pranab Uniyal, head of products at HDFC Securities. Other experts also echoed similar views, saying the rate cut may get pushed beyond June. ""The data does not completely remove the possibility of Fed action this year, but it certainly lessens the chances the Fed is cutting the overnight rate in the next couple months,"" said Phillip Neuhart, director of market and economic research at First Citizens, according to Reuters. ""There is a high-risk cutting rates in June gets pushed out further. The probability is likely going to move lower after today's print, meaning that a June cut is less likely,"" said Ben Vaske, senior investment strategist at Orion, in a Reuters report. Will US CPI halt Indian stock markets rally? The impact may be felt strongly on the Indian markets, which may see a short-term correction, said experts. “There is exuberance across the equity markets and commodities. They are all over stretched and just need a trigger to start correcting. Gold and silver prices, which are up almost 20 percent in last 6-7 weeks also need to correct. This hotter-than-expected inflation data would also cause a trigger for US and Indian markets to correct. US Fed might keep the interest rate unchanged for longer due to the data point,” said Amit Goel, co-founder and chief global strategist at Pace 360. However, Ashish Goel of Investsavy PMS said the market may have only a knee-jerk reaction to the US CPI data, rather than a prolonged period of pain.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/experts-line-up-top-10-bets-for-next-3-4-weeks-as-nifty-hints-at-range-bound-movement-12476931.html,"The market went into the red after a green sweep for five weeks in a row and fell more than 2 percent at the end on March 15. Given the nervousness in the Street, bears took the plunge, paving the road for more volatility with a negative bias in the coming sessions. Experts see support for the market barometer at 21,900-21,850 and, below this, the bears will have a wider room to run the riots. On the higher side, the Nifty may face resistance at 22,200-22,300 and a decisive close above this may charge the bulls to drive the index to record highs. For the week ended March 15, the Nifty 50 declined 470 points to 22,023 and formed a long bearish candlestick pattern which resembles Evening Star kind of a pattern (not the exact one) on the weekly charts with high volumes. On the downside, there are visible multiple bottoms on the hourly chart in the range of 21,900 to 21,850, coinciding with the 50EMA (exponential moving average), suggesting critical support, Rajesh Bhosale, technical analyst at Angel One said. ""Further decline below this level may trigger another round of significant selling, potentially pushing prices towards the previous swing low of 21,500, aligning with the 89EMA."" Going ahead, he advised caution and asked traders to refrain from attempting to catch the falling knife and, instead, wait for clear bullish reversal signals before considering aggressive long positions. Jigar Patel, senior manager of equity research at Angel One, also feels that on the downside, 21,850 stands as a crucial support level, and a breach of this level might push the index towards the 21,600 level. The current breakdown would only be invalidated if the index closes above 22,200, said Patel, who feels the market uncertainty will likely dissipate by the end of the month, allowing the markets to resume their primary upward trend. Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 stocks from experts, with 3-4 weeks perspective. The closing figure of March 15 is considered for the stock return calculation. Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 567 | Stop-Loss: Rs 545 | Target: Rs 610 | Return: 7.4 percent After the remarkable up move of the last few sessions, the counter witnessed short-term correction from the higher levels.

The overall volume in Friday's session was nearly 1.5 times the average (10-day) volume.

Action Construction Equipment: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,241 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,190 | Target: Rs 1,330/1,420 | Return: 7 percent The stock has successfully re-tested its anchor VWAP (volume-weighted average price) support mark of Rs 1,220 and managed to hold well above the same. From a broader perspective, the stock has a minor resistance near Rs 1,330 mark, above which the next hurdle would be somewhere near Rs 1,420 levels. On its hourly charts, the stock is forming a potential higher low at around Rs 1,200 levels. The risk-reward looks favourable on the buy side at the current market price with a set stop-loss at Rs 1,190 mark for potential targets of Rs 1,330 and Rs 1,420.

The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 1,155.  Expert: Jigar Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 419 | Stop-Loss: Rs 390 | Target: Rs 475 | Return: 13 percent After reaching a peak near Rs 475 mark on January 4, 2024, ITC has experienced a significant decline of 16 percent. However, in the subsequent 18 trading sessions, ITC has shown stability by avoiding further declines and has instead consolidated within a range of Rs 400-416. Notably, in the previous trading session, there was notable buying interest observed at lower levels, accompanied by substantial trading volume. From a technical standpoint, the formation of a bullish AB=CD pattern on the daily chart of ITC within the mentioned price zone of Rs 400-416. Interestingly, this zone also coincides with the 0.382 percent retracement level of a price swing that occurred between January 2023 and July 2023, as indicated on the chart.

Britannia Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,974 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,790 | Target: Rs 5,250 | Return: 5.5 percent Following a peak near Rs 5,386 level, Britannia experienced a significant decline of almost 11 percent in its value. However, over the past couple of months, Britannia has stabilized around Rs 4,800 levels, forming a prolonged support base. Notably, this level coincides with the 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA) and represents a 50 percent retracement of its previous upward movement from November 2023 to December 2023, as depicted in the provided chart. Additionally, a bullish AB=CD pattern has emerged near Rs 4,800 level, further confirming positive market sentiment. Furthermore, the daily stochastic indicator indicates a bullish divergence, suggesting a favourable outlook for the Therefore, investors may consider initiating buy positions within the range of Rs 4,950-4,980, targeting an upside objective of Rs 5,250, with a stop-loss set at Rs 4,790 on a daily closing basis.

Read More Nifty remained volatile throughout the day, oscillating between 21,900 and 22,100. Bulls have thus far managed to defend the 21,900 level successfully. However, a dip below 21,900 could strengthen the bears' position, although for now, any downturn is being met with buying activity. On the upside, a sustained upward movement beyond 22,100 may propel the index towards 22,250 and beyond. Support is established at 21,900, below which the index might decline towards 21,700. The Nifty opened on a weak note, however it recovered during the day to close with gains of 32 points. During the day, Nifty has managed to hold on to the support zone of 21900 – 21850 where support parameters in the form the 40-day average and the previous swing low is placed. It is still trading in the range 21900 – 22200 since the last three trading sessions and a decisive breach shall lead to trending moves in that direction. So, until the support zone is held, we can expect the positive momentum to resume. In terms of levels, 22215 – 22250 is the immediate hurdle zone while 21900 – 21860 is the crucial support. Bank Nifty closed the day on a negative note for the seventh consecutive trading session. It has however recovered sharply from the intraday lows (46022). It has in the process held on to the 20-week average which is currently at 46300. We expect the Bank Nifty to recover, and, on the upside, it can rise to 47230 – 47400. The Indian market followed the positive Asian peers with a mixed bias. Domestic issues, like mutual fund stress tests, hardly brought any negative views, but premium valuation remains as a concern. Midcap & small caps are attempting to scroll up, however consolidation persists. Both DII & FIIs inflows are strong for large caps, hence sustaining their outperformance. Policy actions, this week, from global central banks, the US FED, BOJ, and BOE will dictate the market direction. Indication, by the FED, that rate cut may be probably in the latter half of CY24, should bring a mixed sentiment in the short term.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/for-electricity-exchanges-growth-returns-amidst-vortex-of-uncertainty-icici-securities-12605591.html,"Electricity exchanges are seeing renewed growth but uncertainty around plans for market coupling remains, says a new report from ICICI Securities. Market coupling involves pooling all buy and sell bids to arrive at a uniform market price. In FY24, trading volumes on power exchanges grew almost 16 percent on an annualised basis to around 120 billion units (BU) . This increase, according to the report, comes on the back of a 2 percent growth in FY23. India currently has three energy exchanges :IEX(India Energy Exchange), PXIL (Power Energy Exchange) and HPX (Hindustan Power Exchange). IEX is the only listed one among them. Also read:Initial simulations by CERC suggests market coupling will not have any significant benefit: IEX CMD Shares of IEX have fallen around 4 percent over the last one year but gained around 11 percent over the last six months. As on April 9, the stock was trading at Rs 146.70.  According to the report, IEX's market share dropped to 85 percent in FY24 against 87 percent in FY23, while  PXIL's market share dropped to 8 percent from 10 percent. On the other hand, HPX gained to 7 percent from 3 percent in FY23. In Q3FY24, IEX reported an 18.9 percent year-on-year increase in net profit to Rs 91.8 crore. Revenue from operations for the period grew 15 percent to Rs 115.3 crore from Rs 100.27 crore in Q3FY23. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) for the reporting quarter rose to Rs 124.7 crore in the quarter ended December 2023. Volumes at IEX grew 13 percent over the previous year to 102 BU in FY24. According to the report, volumes at PXIL dropped 10 percent annually to 9.4BU. HPX volumes for the same period grew more than 3 times to 8.6BU. Also read:MC Explains: What is market coupling and why is it in the news? Uncertainty amidst power market coupling Market coupling in simple terms is a model where the buying and selling of electricity from all power exchanges in the country are aggregated and matched to discover a uniform market clearing price (MCP). Currently, each of these exchanges collects buy bids and sell offers on their own and comes up with its own MCP. In a February 6 order,  the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) ordered for a ""shadow pilot"" on market coupling of India's power exchanges. As per the order, national load dispatcher Grid-India will develop the necessary software over the next two months to run this shadow pilot. Some analysts have previously expressed concerns that market coupling could result in a decline in market share for all three exchanges and could specifically be of concern to IEX. ICICI Securities analysts added that in the current market, as the last word is yet to be said on market coupling, uncertainty will continue to plague the sector.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rbi-monetary-policy-private-consumption-looks-set-to-gain-steam-soon-governor-das-12581061.html,"Private consumption could see a boost with a pick-up in rural activity and steady urban demand, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said as part of his Monetary Policy announcement on April 5. Das noted that private consumption is likely to gather steam, driven by heightened rural activity and consistent urban demand. “Urban households are projected to increase discretionary spending, as indicated by the Reserve Bank's consumer survey, alongside improving income levels, fostering a positive outlook for private consumption,” he said. He noted that inflation has come down significantly even though it remains above the 4 percent target. He said that efforts are underway to ensure the comprehensive transmission of policy measures and to anchor household inflation expectations. Going forward, the outlook for agriculture and rural activity appears bright, with good rabi wheat crop and improved prospects of kharif crops, due to expected normal south-west monsoon, Das said. Strengthening of rural demand, improving employment conditions and informal sector activity, moderating inflationary pressures and sustained momentum in manufacturing and services sector should boost private consumption, as per the RBI governor. “According to Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), the unemployment rate fell to its lowest in the series at 3.1 percent (usual status) in calendar year 2023. Similarly, labour force sustained momentum in manufacturing and services sector should boost private consumption,” Das said. He added that as per the RBI survey, consumer confidence one year ahead reached a new high. Normalcy in monsoon could boost farm output An anticipated bumper rabi wheat harvest in the 2023-24 season is poised to mitigate cereal prices. Favourable early signs of a normal monsoon bode well for the upcoming kharif season, he said. With the anticipated normalcy in the upcoming southwest monsoon is expected to boost agricultural operations, rural activity is anticipated to amplify, complemented by steadfast urban demand, Das said. “The envisaged rise in discretionary spending among urban households, supported by the Reserve Bank's consumer survey, alongside improving income levels, underscores a favourable landscape for bolstering private consumption. Assuming a normal monsoon, CPI inflation for 2024-25 is projected at 4.5 per cent,” the governor said. “The escalating frequency of climate-related disruptions poses an inherent risk to food prices. Concerns loom over low reservoir levels, particularly in southern regions, coupled with projections of above-normal temperatures during April-June. The tight supply-demand dynamics in certain pulses and the pricing dynamics of essential vegetables warrant close monitoring,” said Das.

Jindal Steel and Poweradded close to 3 percent in OI with sustained positivity. The price action implies that the immediate level of 825 will be met. Here, we see short bets in 850 CE being covered as smart money enters 800 CE. The immediate hurdle comes at the 840 mark, as support emerges near 780, followed by 764, its 50-SMA.  WhileSteel Authority of Indiais hovering around its 50-Simple Moving Average (SMA) placed at 125, the reversal may signal a fresh uptrend for the next session. The price action may move towards the 140 level. The Open Interest has remained flat; however, the momentum is projected to accelerate the price uptrend to 130. Support exists at the 120 level.  Vedantais attempting to cross its 50-SMA and may reach higher levels in the upcoming sessions. The 280 PE is observing the closing of short positions despite 280 CE perceiving writing. The next hurdle comes at 285. Stability over 50-SMA would build a support area around 260-265 levels.

The Praveg stock is down 30 percent from its peak, while those of  Snowman, Gokul, Sarla and Man are down around 20 percent, and Star Cement is down less than 10 percent. While it is early to call a trend, the situation is markedly different from a month ago when there were more instances of promoters selling shares than buying. Follow our live blog for all market action Insiders buying their own shares is a much stronger signal than selling shares, market experts say. While insider selling could be for a variety of reasons, promoter buying is a good enough sign that the stock may be undervalued. Proof of that is the fact that the promoters are willing to shell out money to back their view. At the same time, it is not a given that promoter buying always signals undervaluation. The quantum of purchases should give an idea. If the promoter is willing to invest a meaningful amount, it means the shares are undervalued. If the quantum of purchase is not huge, the promoter may be sending out a signal that the stock is undervalued.Also read Mid and smallcap shares have fallen sharply this month on a combination of factors.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/india-vs-the-world-nifty-outpaces-china-japan-korea-indices-will-the-outperformance-continue-12615841.html,"As Indian markets hit fresh record highs in 2024, with the Sensex blazing past 75,000 and the Nifty moving towards 22,800, they are turning up the heat on global markets, outpacing several emerging and even developed markets. Over the past year alone, Nifty has soared 27 percent, eclipsing the modest 7 percent rise seen in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, which was dragged by Chinese heavyweights like Alibaba and Tencent. Over longer time periods though, Sensex and Nifty have delivered returns in line with global counterparts such as the US, China, Japan and Korea. Over the past 10 years, Sensex and Nifty delivered dollar returns of 109 percent and 110 percent, respectively. India's outperformance is attributed to what analysts call the Goldilocks moment, owing to favourable macroeconomic conditions, robust corporate earnings, stabilised interest rates, manageable inflation, and consistent policy momentum. Factors such as digitisation, expanding manufacturing capabilities, and a burgeoning housing sector, all buoyed by regulatory reforms and a growing middle class have also pushed the markets higher. Despite global economic uncertainties and inflation concerns, India's resilience shines through, capturing the attention of investors worldwide.  It’s not just the domestic growth pull that is leading global investors to flock to Indian markets. India's allure has been gaining momentum as global investors seek substitutes for sickly Chinese markets and as expectations grow that national elections this year will see Prime Minister Narendra Modi return for a rare third term, assuring investors of both political and policy continuity. Besides, Indian investors are also hooked to the stock markets putting money into Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) of mutual funds that give them the heft to support markets during dips. India versus the big EMs The meltdown in China's real estate industry caused a rout in equities pulling the Shanghai index down 13 percent in the last one year. The gap in weightage between the Indian and Chinese equities on the MSCI index has been narrowing with many global giants picking up shares on Dalal Street over those in Shanghai. Earlier this year, India surpassed Taiwan in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, securing the second position after China and affirming its status as an attractive investment option in emerging markets. Also Read |Market valuations may be stretched but there are pockets of value, say experts India’s share in the MSCI Emerging Markets index saw a significant jump over the last eight years, rising to 17.2 percent and is projected to rise further to 20 percent this year, according to Nuvama Institutional Equities. The relentless rally in Indian stocks has coincided with a historic downturn in Hong Kong, home to some of China’s most influential and innovative firms. The stringent Covid-related curbs, regulatory crackdowns on corporations, a property-sector crisis and geopolitical tensions with the West combined to erode China’s appeal as the world’s growth engine, and triggering an equities rout with the Hang Seng index tanking 16 percent in the last one year. Moreover, new listings have dried up in Hong Kong, leading to the Asian financial hub losing its position as one of the world’s busiest platforms for initial public offerings. On the flip side, India has seen a boom in IPOs, some of which were subscribed 60 times or even 100 times. Japan's Nikkei 225 this year smashed the 40,000 mark for the first time, continuing its comeback after decades of stagnation. However, the index has fallen 1 percent in the last one year, underperforming India Nifty as the Asian peer dealt with a shrinking population and rigid labour force, weighing on growth. Japan's economy officially entered recession earlier this year, giving up its spot as the world’s third-largest economy to Germany. The flows out of Japan also helped push Indian equities higher. India versus the US Despite higher bond yields, red hot inflation and constant recession threat, Wall Street's flagship index S&P 500 managed to keep up with India's Nifty, rising 27 percent in the last one year. Nifty outperformed Dow Jones by a margin. However, tech-heavy Nasdaq outpaced with returns of 34 percent during this period. While the US indices have managed to keep up with the buoyant Indian indices, a stronger-than-expected CPI inflation reading, at both the headline and the core level or a delay in interest rate cuts by the Fed could end up triggering a correction, according to analysts. India's outperformance to continue? Several market experts assert that the ongoing bull run in India is unparalleled in terms of wealth generation, which is reflected in the high market capitalisation of companies. The nation's mini-Goldilocks moment is being supported by healthy flows, and it now boasts a unique combination of size and growth, according to Motilal Oswal. Veteran investor Mark Mobius believes that China's market slowdown will only help India with more foreign investments. And investors seem happy to overlook risks, such as the already lofty valuations and any political surprises. Also Read |Sensex @75K: Four risks investors should not rule out International brokerage Haitong remains convinced of the strength in Indian markets in the long term, and expects to see a strong pickup post-elections.

India is likely to see rainfall to the tune of 102% of the long period average during the period, with an error margin of plus or minus 5%, it said in a report released today. However, the agency predicted a weak start tomonsoon this year due to El Nino effect, adding that these conditions may swiftly change into La Nina. The long period average for rainfall during the JunSep monsoon season is set at 868.8 mm for the country, according to the private weather forecaster. ""The spread of normal is 96-104% of LPA (long period average),"" it added. ""El Nino is swiftly flipping over to La Nina. And, the monsoon circulation inclines to be stronger during La Nina years,"" Jatin Singh, managing director at Skymet, said in the report. ""Also, the transition from Super El Nino to strong La Nina has historically tended to produce a decent monsoon."" However, Singh said the start of monsoon this year may not be as good due to the remnant effects of El Nino over the country. ""The second half of the season will have an overwhelming edge over the primal phase (in terms of rainfall),"" he added. ElNino, an abnormal warming of surface ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific, is usually associated with lower rainfall in India, while La Nina brings more moisture and precipitation across the country. Earlier this month, the India Meteorological Departmenthad forecast a hotter-than-usual summer during Apr-Jun, and said the El Nino weather phenomenon is likely to weaken and transition into La Nina conditions during the second half of the monsoon season. The government's weather bureau is yet to announce the date for its first forecast on the upcoming monsoon season. Rainfall distribution was eschewed during last year's monsoon due to formation of El Nino, with many regions receiving erratic rains. Hopes for a better spatial distribution of monsoon rainfall this year comes with the country facing a shortage in water levels in key reservoirs.

Analysis of the Open Interest (OI) data revealed the highest OI on the call side at the 22,000 strike price, followed by the 22,200 strike price. On the put side, the highest OI was observed at the 21,500 strike price. Following the BoJ's decision to hike interest rates for the first time in 17 years, the Asian peers’ mood turned sour, which pulled the Indian market to continue its recent pessimism. The correction in the domestic market has also been triggered by concerns over premium valuations and the delay of rate cuts by the US Fed due to hotter than expected inflation, which is evident from the upward trend in the dollar index. Investors are exercising caution as they await the upcoming US Fed meeting, seeking indications on the potential timing of a reversal in the rate cycle. Additionally, the gradual increase in crude oil prices is further dampening market sentiment. The Nifty has broken down from the rising wedge pattern on the daily chart, suggesting a potential reversal of the uptrend. Additionally, it has fallen below the critical short-term moving average, indicating weakening momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also shown a bearish crossover, indicating increasing selling pressure. Key levels to watch include resistance at 22000 and support at 21800. A drop below 21700 could lead to further correction in the Nifty index. The BankNifty experienced another day of sideways trading, indicating ongoing indecision between bulls and bears, marked by the formation of a doji candle. Key levels to watch include support at 46000 and resistance at 47000, where the highest put and call open interests are concentrated. A breakout beyond this range is awaited for a directional move; however, within the range, the bullish sentiment prevails. Traders may consider adopting a buy-on-dip strategy, with 46000 as a stop-loss level. The rupee depreciated by 13 paise, closing at Rs 83.04 against the US dollar. This decline is primarily driven by a significant rise in the dollar index, which surged by $0.70 to $103.70. This surge stems from a shift in expectations regarding the US Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. Markets now anticipate that the Fed will hold off on interest rate cuts in March, potentially delaying them until June or July. This shift in sentiment has strengthened the dollar across the board, leading to a general weakening of other currencies, including the rupee. Looking ahead, the ongoing two-day policy review by the Fed will be crucial. The tone of the Fed's statements will likely impact the dollar's trajectory. A hawkish stance could further bolster the dollar, potentially pushing it towards $104.50 and weakening the rupee to around 83.20. -India can take a lot more of issuance-Fresh issuance crossing $100 billion will bring fresh set of investors-Fresh issuance crossing 100 billion will bring more investments as it will allow investors, especially FIIs to liquidate positions-Real estate is one white space that's going to grow.

Meanwhile, India's 10-year bond yield was stable as it rose by three basis points to 7.12 percent after RBI retained 'withdrawal of accomodation' stance. Announcingthe policy decision, RBI governor Shakikanta Das said that last-mile of disinflation was turning out to be a major challenge globally. ""Services inflation remains sticky in advanced economies. However, the outlook for rural and agricultural activity continues to remain bright,"" Das said. The RBI projected consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 4.5 percent for FY25, assuming normal monsoon. Surplus liquidity talks to spark rate-sensitive stocks, say market experts Apart from that, the RBI updated improvement in liquidity situation in March. ""The liquidity conditions have improved during February and March in the wake of increased government spending, Reserve Bank’s market operations, and the return leg of US dollar and Indian Rupees sale by swap auction,"" he explained. Market experts believe that this RBI's liquidity management efforts may lead to a positive reaction in the stock market, particularly banking stocks. ""Any indication of accommodative monetary policy measures could further bolster investor confidence, potentially driving upward momentum in the stock market. Banking sectors could benefit from the RBI's focus on liquidity management, while sectors sensitive to interest rate changes, such as real estate and infrastructure, may also see some impact,"" said Sonam Srivastava, Founder and Fund Manager at Wright Research. For growth, the Governor mentioned resilient GDP growth across the globe. Das kept real GDP growth for FY25 at 7 percent, Q1FY25 to be 7.1 percent, Q2 to be 6.9 percent and both Q3 and Q4 to be at 7 percent. As RBI maintains FY25 growth forecast, analysts see no hurry to cut rates Equity strategists believe that since India is standing tall on the growth front, the RBI may not be in a hurry to cut interest rates before the US Federal Reserve does. ""The RBI has enough space for holding repo rate steady, with its FY25 GDP growth being quite strong at 7 percent in order to target the 4 percent inflation mark,"" said Suvodeep Rakshit, Senior Economist, Kotak Institutional Equities.

Buoyancy of the broad market indicates the strength will continue in the short term. Meanwhile, strong US economic data has cast doubts on the Fed rate cut in June that the market was expecting.

They are Tata Consultancy Services, Cupid, Anand Rathi Wealth, Krystal Integrated Services, Popular Vehicles and Services, and Teamo Productions HQ. CPI India's consumer price index (CPI) data will be released on March 12. CPI inflation is expected to ease to 4.7 percent in March, owing to a decline in food and fuel prices, and a slight easing of momentum in core inflation, said  Shreya Sodhani, Regional Economist at Barclays. ""The disinflation is broadly attributed to easing in momentum across food, fuel, and core items, though some base effects also helped. Headline CPI likely fell 0.12 percent month-on-month (MoM), driven by sequentially lower vegetable, LPG, and gasoline prices,"" said Sodhani. Along with CPI data, data on industrial production in February and foreign exchange reserves for the week ended April 5  will also be released on April 12. US inflation and FOMC minutes The US will announce its inflation data on April 10. At the last meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had opted to maintain the federal funds interest rate at the current target range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent. The US Federal Reserve (the Fed) has not changed its interest rate target since July 2023, keeping rates at a 22-year high in its ongoing fight against inflation. Global economic dataMarket participants will also keep an eye on the European Central Bank interest rate, which will be announced next week. China inflation numbers, US jobs data, and producer price index numbers from US, China, and Japan will also keep the street busy.

Technically, the Nifty is likely to be rangebound in the coming week, unless it decisively breaks 22,600 on the higher side, or 22,300-22,200 on the lower side. Either breach can give firm direction to the market, experts said. ""Traders should continue with a buy-on-dips approach until Nifty breaks 22,200,"" advised Ajit Mishra, SVP, Technical Research, at Religare Broking. On the higher side, it can inch towards the 22,700-22,850 zone, he said. F&O cues Weekly options data continued to indicate that 22,500 is expected to be crucial for the Nifty 50, with 22,800 likely to be a key resistance on the higher side and 22,400 to be the immediate support for the index.

Even as they face a continued global demand slowdown, they are not holding back on capital expenditure to enhance capacity, despite this adding to stress on their balance sheets. However, the near-term pain could mean long-term gain given that the outlook for the country's chemicals sector is robust, especially helped by the capacities coming onstream now. The impact of destocking in Europe and the US has significantly dented global demand, while a decline in Chinese demand has prompted companies there to offload inventories in other regions. This has collectively resulted in a downward pressure on prices. ""In several of the segments, despite a poor global demand, China appears to have been raising its production in 2023, putting downward pressure on realisations, especially for domestic players,"" brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher highlighted. The weak demand environment also coincided with a time when domestic chemical players were going big on capacity expansion to reap the benefits of the growing China+1 sentiment. But in the face of the demand slowdown, chemical players are now feeling the heat of the ongoing capital expenditure, which is weighing on their margins. Slow demand, margin pressure drive bearish ratings on chemical stocks Anticipating prolonged pressure on demand and margins for the chemicals sector, Prabhudas Lilladher, like many other brokerages, opted for a cautious view. The firm has a 'hold' rating on Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Jubilant Ingrevia, Clean Science Technology and Fine Organic Industries. It has a 'reduce' call on SRF, Vinati Organics, Aarti Industries, Deepak Nitrate and NOCIL. The brokerage has a 'sell' recommendation on Laxmi Organic. In contrast, Navin Fluorine emerged as the only chemical stock garnering an upgrade to 'buy' from the brokerage, largely due to the recent correction in the stock price. The concerns of further pressure on the sector become clearer when one looks at their Q3 report card. Chemical companies’ revenues, margins hit In the fiscal third quarter, 8 out of 22 chemical companies recorded their lowest quarterly sales since the COVID-19 outbreak. Four companies’ sales were close to their lowest quarterly numbers since the pandemic. Additionally, 16 of these companies reported a year-on-year decline in revenue. Also Read |Indian chemical players had big hopes riding on China+1, but reality dashes them Furthermore, 12 companies witnessed a drop in gross margins compared to the same quarter last year, with 8 of them also reporting a sequential decline. The situation was more challenging concerning EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margins primarily due to the aggressive capex undertaken. Eighteen companies reported a year-on-year decline while 11 showed a sequential contraction in EBITDA margins.  Pain to continue for a few more quarters The sector was once among India's brighter prospects due to China+1 and a slump in European specialty chemicals production. However, changing dynamics globally suggest that pain due to muted demand and pricing pressure is likely to persist till at least the first quarter of FY25, meaning there is still a long way for the stock prices of chemical companies to recover from a correction that began last year. AK Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital, said the six-month outlook for the sector is not encouraging for investors. ""One or more quarters of bad results will be possible. People who have long-term views need not worry,” he said. Long-term outlook bright While the near-term pressure is most likely to persist, analysts as well as industry participants are bullish on the sector's long-term growth trajectory, also helped by the capacity expansion under way. Maulik Patel, chairman and managing director at chemicals company Epigral, is already seeing green shoots emerging in the domestic market and anticipates global demand to normalise by the end of the first half of FY25. That is when he expects the increased capacity of the domestic chemical industry to begin yielding results. Patel also justifies the capex undertaken by chemical majors even as demand remained muted. He believes the capex will push India up the ladder when competing with China, which is the world's largest producer of chemicals. ""China is strong in the specialty chemical space as it commands a fully vertical integration of production. In that context, Indian chemical companies stood at a disadvantage if they did not move towards the path of vertical integration. Hence, the recent capex unleashed by the industry will help in presenting itself as an alternate vendor to China when demand revives,"" Patel said in an interaction withMoneycontrol. Patel is also betting on the domestic demand to aid a recovery in the industry. ""FY24 turned out to be a tumultuous year for the chemical sector. But now we expect to see improvement in FY25 as demand comes back, while FY26 is likely to turn out much better,"" Patel said. Also Read |Speciality chemical stocks: When will the pain end?

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/as-nifty-may-see-fresh-buying-on-regaining-22500-bet-on-these-3-stocks-for-10-15-return-12551151.html,"The week ended March 28 proved to be a resounding success for bullish investors in the domestic markets, leading to a highly optimistic closure for the week, month, and the financial year. Despite being truncated because of two national holidays, the Nifty index consistently traded in the positive territory across sessions. Throughout the last week, there were notable attempts by the benchmark to surpass the significant 22,500 mark, indicating a strong bullish sentiment in the market, although it ultimately closed below this threshold. The last week, however, concluded with gains of over a percent, reflecting the positive momentum and sentiment among investors. Overall, it was a week marked by optimism and upward momentum, underscoring the resilience and confidence in the domestic markets. Last week, our analysis centered around the crucial support of the 50-day exponential moving average (DEMA) for the Nifty index. Additionally, we delved into the bullish harmonic shark pattern and the morning star candlestick pattern. The impact of these technical indicators was evidently observed throughout the week, as they contributed to pulling the index back to the significant 22,500 mark. However, a notable occurrence during the final hour of the preceding trading session led to a substantial pullback, driving the index towards the 22,300 mark, prompting a degree of scepticism in our outlook. Despite our prior bullish stance, we now anticipate fresh rounds of buying activity only if the index surpasses the 22,500 level or nears the 22,100 levels, owing to the emergence of negative divergence in the relative strength index (RSI) across multiple time frames. This divergence signifies a potential short-term reversal in momentum. For the medium term, we maintain our optimistic outlook, asserting that as long as the support at 21,700 remains intact, the index retains the potential for further upward movement. Looking ahead, the short-term support level has been adjusted to 22,000 for the current week starting from April 1, underscoring the dynamic nature of market trends and the importance of vigilant analysis in navigating fluctuations. Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks: Orient Cement: Buy | LTP: Rs 196 | Stop-Loss: Rs 179 | Target: Rs 225 | Return: 15 percent Following a peak near the Rs 293 level, Orient Cement encountered a notable downturn, marked by a sharp decline of 35 percent in its overall value. Despite this downturn, Orient Cement has shown signs of stabilisation around Rs 190 levels for the last week, establishing a sustained support base. It's noteworthy that the level of Rs 190 aligns with the Fibonacci ratio clustering, as indicated in the chart. Moreover, during this period, a 1:1 leg has also formed around this support zone, further reinforcing a bullish sentiment in the stock. An analysis of the daily scale RSI indicator reveals a bullish hidden divergence, suggesting a favourable outlook for Orient Cement. Taking into account these factors along with chart patterns, investors may find it prudent to consider initiating buy positions within the range of Rs 190-198, with an upside objective of Rs 225. To manage the risks effectively, it's advisable to set a stop-loss order at Rs 179 on a daily closing basis, providing protection against potential downside movements.  ABB India: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,361 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,950 | Target: Rs 7,000 | Return: 10 percent In the recent trading session, ABB India showed a significant breakout above the R4 camarilla pivot (Rs 6,111.4), maintaining its position above this level. Additionally, daily stochastics have ventured into the overbought territory, suggesting a bullish momentum anticipated in the upcoming days. The combination of price action persisting above the R4 camarilla pivot and stochastics registering as overbought presents a compelling technical confluence, reinforcing the bullish sentiment surrounding ABB India. Investors may consider initiating a 'buy' position within the range of Rs 6,250-6,400, targeting an upside potential of Rs 7,000, while prudently placing a stop-loss near Rs 5,950 based on the daily closing prices. Hindustan Unilever: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,264 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,145 | Target: Rs 2,500 | Return: 10 percent Since reaching its peak around the Rs 2,669 mark on January 1, 2024, Hindustan Unilever has experienced a notable downturn, witnessing a significant decline of approximately 16 percent. However, in the subsequent six trading sessions, Hindustan Unilever has displayed resilience, avoiding further declines and instead consolidating within a range spanning from Rs 2,230 to Rs 2,280. Notably, within this price range, a bullish AB=CD pattern has formed on the daily chart of Hindustan Unilever. This range also corresponds with the 0.50 percent retracement level of a price swing observed between March 2022 and July 2023, as depicted on the chart. Additionally, on a daily scale, the RSI has exhibited a complex structure (W shape) along with some regular bull divergence on the 4-hour chart. Interestingly, the mentioned range of Rs 2,230-2,280 aligns with S5 Camarilla Pivot (Rs 2,243), suggesting a potentially attractive buying opportunity. Therefore, it might be prudent to consider buying within the range of Rs 2,250-2,280, aiming for an upside target of Rs 2,500, while setting a stop-loss near Rs 2,145 on a daily closing basis. This comprehensive analysis highlights potential trading opportunities and risk management strategies for traders and investors considering positions in Hindustan Unilever.

The index traded above all key moving averages on the daily charts, while on the monthly charts, it has maintained higher highs, higher lows for fifth consecutive month ended on March 28. As long as the index holds the 22,200 level, it may hit a record high of 22,526 in the coming days, while the psychological 22,000 mark is expected to be a crucial support area for the index, experts said. The Nifty 50 rallied above 22,500 on expiry day but profit-booking at higher levels in late trade trimmed gains and, as a result, the index edged up 1 percent in the week to 22,327. The RSI Smoothened indicator that recently witnessed a dip has turned northward and is flashing fresh buy signals. In the week beginning April 1, close attention will be paid to the all-time high levels above 22,500, as hesitation was evident at these levels, Rajesh Bhosale, technical analyst at Angel One, said. He feels a sustained trade or a close above this point would confirm the resumption of the primary uptrend, potentially triggering a further rally in April. ""Notably, 22,500 and then 22,680 stand as significant hurdles on the upside.

The closing price of March 28 is considered for stock price calculation. Expert: Nandish Shah, senior technical/derivative research analyst at HDFC Securities S H Kelkar: Buy | LTP: Rs 205.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 192 | Targets: Rs 225, 234 | Return: 14 percent The stock price has broken out on the monthly chart from the symmetrical triangle with rise in volumes.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,447.9 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,395 | Target: Rs 1,550 | Return: 7 percent After a short-term correction, the stock has formed reversal formation. On weekly charts, it has formed long bullish candle and after a long time the stock succeeded to close above 50-day SMA (simple moving average) which is largely positive. We are of the view that, until it is trading above Rs 1,395, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 1,550. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any between Rs 1,430 and Rs 1,410 levels with a stop-loss below Rs 1,395.  Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 155.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 150 | Target: Rs 168 | Return: 8 percent On daily and weekly charts, the stock has holding higher high and higher low series formation. Currently the stock is comfortably trading above 20-day SMA (simple moving average) and the texture of the charts indicating uptrend formation is likely to continue in the near future.

The RSI (14) on daily charts is touching 51, which indicates good momentum and strength in the counter. Volume in Thursday's session was almost 1.75 times its average (30) days traded volumes, which again signals overall strength. At the current market price of Rs 610.95, the stock looks like a good buy with a strict stop-loss at Rs 585 for potential target of Rs 650 and above.  Grasim Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,287.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,200 | Target: Rs 2,400 | Return: 5 percent The stock has given a good breakout above its recent all-time high mark of Rs 2,268 on its daily charts. With the volumes in stock being nearly 2 times, its average (30) days traded volume, the overall momentum looks strong, and the minor uptick in RSI (14) on daily charts from 52 to 63 is also indicating overall strength on the counter. With a small stop-loss at Rs 2,200, we can see potential upside targets of Rs 2,400 and above in Grasim Industries.

An immediate support is placed around Rs 741.

RSI (14) on daily charts is currently around 55, which is signaling good momentum and strength on the stock.

(TTAN) to gain insights on jewelry industry demand, rising competition, and the company’s growth strategy for its business segments, such as jewelry, lab-grown diamonds (LGDs), and non-jewelry. Following are key takeaways:  Demand has remained steady in Jan’24/Feb’24; however, gold inflation in Mar’24 has led to delay in demand (a typical trend in gold inflation months). While the company continues to expand its store network, it is also focusing on better execution at the existing stores (added ~340 jewelry stores in the last two years). TTAN has reduced the gold premium compared to peers in a calibrated manner, which has been compensated with other initiatives to protect operating margin. The management believes that jewelry EBIT margin of 12-13% is sustainable despite rising competition. LGDs have seen success in many developed countries, yet TTAN is not sure it would participate in LGDs. Outlook We model a CAGR of 17% in revenue, 23% in EBITDA, and 26% in PAT during FY24-26. TTAN’s valuation is rich but its superior competitive positioning (sourcing, studded ratio, consumer trust, youth-centric, reinvestment) and business moats are not easily replicable.

We are of the opinion that this downturn is solely a result of the broader market correction affecting midcap stocks, and IRB possesses considerable growth potential stemming from its increased number of free cash flow generating projects. Our conviction in the growth story is further emboldened by the fact that Cintra (an affiliate of Ferrovial) is looking to acquire a shareholding of 24% in IRB Infrastructure Trust (IRBTrust) from GIC. The valuation exercise undertaken for this transfer values the initial 10 projects of IRBTrust at INR 190 bn. This raises the value of IRB’s share of 51% to INR 97 bn for 10 assets. In addition, IRB has submitted claims to the NHAI concerning the Ahmedabad-Vadodara project for claim of competing road. The order has been reserved and awaiting final clearance from regulatory bodies. These claims have not been factored into our forecasts and represent an upside risk to our estimates. Outlook We value IRB on a SOTP basis for a price target of INR 134 per share and recommend a BUY at a CMP of INR 61.4 per share, representing an upside potential of 118.2% over the next 24 months.

Analysts suggest that these moves could help the company regain some of its competitive edge by offering a better experience to users. The Vodafone Idea fundraising could materialise with a follow-on public offer (FPO) in a week or two, CNBC Awaaz reported a day earlier, citing sources. The company is looking to raise around Rs 15,000-20,000 crore from the FPO, and the board had given its approval in February, as it looks to infuse capital to finance the much-delayed 5G rollout and to strengthen its 4G services. Moneycontrolhad reported on March 1 that Vodafone Idea was in talks with investment banks to strike an efficient fundraising structure, one that would optimise various avenues, including rights issue, preferential allotment, or a follow-on public offering. Without adequate funding, it is possible that the telecom player could lose the customer base, and hence the intense market focus on the development, as it looks to boost average revenue per user (ARPU).

The trend is likely to continue in the coming days, provided the index holds the 22,000 level. Along the way up, the Nifty may face hurdles at 22,250-22,300 and, if this level is broken decisively, then a record high can't be ruled out. On the downside, it the index breaches the 22,000 level, then 21,900 is going to be next support level and then 21,700, the low of the last week, according to experts. The benchmark Nifty 50 climbed third of a percent during the week ended March 22 and closed at 22,097, forming a bullish candlestick pattern with long lower shadow on the weekly charts, indicating buying interest at lower levels, after a long bear candle in the previous week.

On the higher end, he feels 22,200-22,250 is expected to act as an intermediate hurdle, and an authoritative closure above the same could only bring some mojo back into the market. Shilpa Rout, AVP of Derivatives Research at Prabhudas Lilladher, also sees support for the Nifty at 21,700 and the resistance is very strongly placed around 22,300. ""Until we breach either side of the range, the same kind of volatility might continue."" Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 stock ideas from experts, with 3-4 weeks perspective. The closing price of March 22 is considered for stock price return calculation. Expert: Subash Gangadharan, senior technical/derivative analyst at HDFC Securities Aptech: Buy | LTP: Rs 241 | Stop-Loss: Rs 210 | Target: Rs 280 | Return: 16 percent The stock is now in a healthy short term uptrend after making a double bottom pattern around Rs 201 levels. On last Thursday, the stock has broken out of its recent trading range on the back of healthy volumes, which augurs well for the uptrend to continue. Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20-day SMA (simple moving average) and momentum indicators like the 14-day RSI (relative strength index) are in rising mode and have crossed their previous highs, suggesting that momentum is picking up. Buying can be initiated at CMP (Rs 241), and more can be added on dips down to Rs 230. Upside target is at Rs 280 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 210.  GMR Airports Infrastructure: Buy | LTP: Rs 78.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 74 | Target: Rs 89 | Return: 13 percent The recent downward correction seems to have halted. The stock has bounced back from the low of Rs 73, which is close to its previous intermediate lows. And last week, the stock has broken out of the recent trading range of Rs 73-78.75. Buying can be initiated at CMP (Rs 78.65), and more can be added on dips down to Rs 77. Upside target is at Rs 89 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs Rs 74. Ceat: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,593 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,450 | Target: Rs 2,800 | Return: 8 percent After a sharp fall in the stock last week that saw it testing a low of Rs 2,428, Ceat has bounced back strongly last week and taken out its recent swing high of Rs 2,565. In the process, momentum readings like the 14-day RSI too have bounced back strongly from oversold levels. One may look to buy Ceat at CMP (Rs 2,593), add more on dips down to Rs 2,530 and wait for the upside target of Rs 2,800 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 2,450.  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, head equity research at Kotak Securities Cummins India: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,930.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,840 | Target: Rs 3,150 | Return: 7.5 percent On the short-term time frame, the stock has witnessed remarkable up move from the lower levels. In addition, on weekly charts, it has formed long bullish candle, which is indicating further uptrend from current levels. The texture of the pattern suggest breakout action will continue in the near term. For the breakout traders Rs 2,840 would be the key level to watch out, above the same it could move up to Rs 3,150 levels.  HDFC Life Insurance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 624 | Stop-Loss: Rs 600 | Target: Rs 670 | Return: 7.4 percent On the weekly scale, the counter is into a rising channel chart formation with higher high and higher low series pattern. The technical indicators like ADX (average directional index) is also indicating further up trend from current levels, which could boost the bullish momentum in coming horizon.

Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 152 | Stop-Loss: Rs 145 | Target: Rs 162 | Return: 7 percent The stock has shown a robust rally from the lower levels in the recent trading sessions. Moreover, there is a fresh breakout along with decent volume activity from the triangle chart formation. As a result, the comfortable close above its breakout levels suggest upward momentum to persist in the coming horizon. Unless it is trading below Rs 145 positional traders can retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 162.  Expert: Om Mehra, technical analyst at SAMCO Securities Gujarat Gas: Buy | LTP: Rs 529 | Stop-Loss: Rs 500 | Target: Rs 575 | Return: 9 percent The stock surged from its support zone in the past two trading sessions with significant volume, signalling strong buying interest. The RSI's recovery from 35 to around 41 also suggests increasing strength in the stock. Furthermore, the Hammer formation near the support zone indicates investors are turning bullish. The lower Bollinger Bands indicate strong support as well. If the stock manages to break above Rs 532 level, it could further move higher. Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP Rs 529 for a target price of Rs 575. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 500. Computer Age Management Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,089 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,950 | Target: Rs 3,350 | Return: 8.4 percent Computer Age Management Services stock reveals a strong recovery after a decent correction, forming a sturdy base around Rs 2,900 level.

With the ADX on the daily timeframe being at 37.08, momentum looks strong, and the stock is poised for a good upside rally. Volume in Friday's session was slightly more than the average (30) days traded volume on the stock, which depicts strength on the counter. A strict stop-loss should be kept at Rs 99 mark for potential upside target of Rs 140 and above.  Juniper Hotels: Buy | LTP: Rs 505.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 469 | Target: Rs 600 | Return: 19 percent The stock has given a strong breakout above its recent swing high mark of Rs 503.70 on the daily timeframe charts, supported by its moving averages (5 and 9-period EMA, respectively). With the RSI (14) on daily charts being around 67.51, momentum is looking positive on the counter. In Friday's session, the stock has also given a good re-test to its breakout zone, which makes the stock an attractive buy at current levels with a low-risk stop-loss that can be kept at Rs 469 mark for potential upside target of Rs 600 and beyond. Azad Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,331.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,200 | Target: Rs 1,465 | Return: 10 percent The stock has given a good breakout above its important moving averages and indicated good follow-up buying above its recent high of Rs 1,269.50. The stock was locked at a 5 percent upper circuit in Friday's session, with the volumes being slightly higher than the average (30) days traded volume. With the ADX being near 20.12, momentum is still on the lower side, and the stock should be eyed as a good buy near Rs 1,275 - 1,300 odd levels with a stop- loss kept at Rs 1,200 for potential upside target of Rs 1,465 and above.

The brokerage has initiated coverage on Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) and Data Patterns with a 'buy' call and continues to maintain the same rating for Bharat Electronics (BEL). At 9:40am on April 2, BEL was trading 2.25 percent higher at Rs 215.85, HAL was trading 0.7 percent higher at Rs 3,427.10, and Data Patterns at Rs 2,725.95, nearly 6.3 percent higher. Follow our market blog for live updates According to Jefferies, when it comes to the defence segment, the government's focus on building country-to-country relations to promoteexports is acting as an icing on the cake. Moreover, doubling of domestic defence spend for the period from FY2024 to FY2030 should continue to drive stocks upwards. ""We believe India’s capital defence spend should continue at the 7-8 percent CAGR seen in the last decade while an Indigenisation focus will drive double-digit growth in domestic defence spend,"" the report added. Also read:Half of Nifty defence index stocks turn multibaggers in FY24, 5 of them PSUs Another area of opportunity for the segment, according to the report, is exports. Defence export opportunity could average a 21 percent growth rate in FY23-30. While India’s defence exports rose 16 times in FY17-24 to $3 billion, the brokerage estimates it to reach $7 billion by Fy30 with opportunities coming in from the UAE, Bhutan, Ethiopia, Italy and Egypt. The government has a defence export target of $6 billion by FY2029. The brokerage estimates thatData Patterns(target price: Rs 3,545), which is the largest private sector player in defence, should see revenues rise nearly five times in FY24-2030 on the back of increased focus on indigenisation and a strong export pipeline. ""ROE improvement and reducing working capital intensity are the other drivers,"" the report said. BEL(target price: Rs 260), according to Jefferies, is well-placed to benefit from growth opportunities in the segment due to its ""zero debt and comfortable working capital position"". ForHAL(target price: Rs 3,900), the brokerage suggests that the recent tie-up with shows potential of moving up in the OEM status among global defence companies. Additionally, 55-70 percent of Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) revenues is service income linked to past product sales and recurring. Product business should rise faster as the government is encouraging domestic aircraft manufacturing, according to the brokerage.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-fall-amid-dull-global-cues-but-analysts-maintain-bullish-bias-in-the-near-term-12565201.html,"Domestic benchmark indices the Sensex and the Nifty fell for the second consecutive day on April 3 morning, tracking dull global cues and rising US bond yields. Equity experts, however, maintained their bullish bias and said upward movement is anticipated in the coming days. The Sensex was down 271.96 points, or 0.37 percent, at 73,631.95 and the Nifty was down 83.60 points, or 0.37 percent, at 22,369.70 on opening deals. The market breadth favoured gainers, as about 1,497 shares advanced, 987 declined and 121 were unchanged. Vaishali Parekh, Vice-President of Technical Research, at Prabhudas Lilladher, said the Nifty can move to 22,800-23,400 in the near term, with support near 22,200. ""The support for the day is seen at 22,200 level, while resistance would be seen at 22,600,"" she said. Follow our live blog for all the market action The spoiler of the current bullish sentiment is the rising treasury bond yields, said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. The 10-year US treasury note jumped to 4.3 percent, the highest level seen since November 2, 2023. The spike came after traders reassessed possibility of the Federal Reserve rate cuts in June. The odds for a June rate cut rate based on fed futures trading was down roughly to 63 percent, off from about 70 percent a week ago, according to CME-FedWatch tool. The moves came after investors interpreted expansion in US manufacturing for the first time since September 2022. Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services viewed that the rate cut possibility from the Fed was fading since labour market remained tight and rising crude fueled inflation fears. ""Even though the Fed chief has been sounding dovish recently, the market is now less optimistic about 3 rate cuts in 2024. This will continue to be a drag on equity markets globally,"" he highlighted.

On the flipside, Nifty Media and Nifty Metal indices gained up to 0.6 percent. Nifty IT index saw some relief after a day's loss as CLSA upgraded target prices of TCS to Rs 4,043 apiece, HCL Tech to Rs 1,553 per share, and Wipro to Rs 445 apiece. ""We expect TCS to top charts in terms of constant currency sequential growth,"" said analysts at CLSA. From an investment standpoint, Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services hinted at valuation comfort in largecaps. Since Nifty is up 3 percent from March lows, he remained positive on overall markets.

Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities The index has remained sideways throughout the session, reflecting a pause in the market trend following the formation of a hanging man pattern. The sentiment may continue to remain sideways due to the lack of a directional breakout or pattern formation. At the higher end, 22650 might prove to be a crucial resistance level. A fresh rally is not anticipated as long as the index remains below 22650. On the lower end, support is evident at 22300; if breached, the index might decline towards the 22000-21900 range. Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas The Nifty opened on a weak note and consolidated during the day. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty consolidated and traded within the range of the previous trading session. The Nifty appears to be consolidating after a sharp run-up which is a healthy sign. We expect the consolidation to breakout on the upside and thus minor degree corrections should be bought into. On the upside we expect levels of 22700 which is the upper end of the rising channel. On the downside crucial support is placed at 22400 – 22350. As far as Bank Nifty is concerned, it has been outperforming and we expect the outperformance to continue. On the upside the immediate hurdle is placed at 48636 and above that the rally is likely to continue till 49300. The zone of 47700 – 47500 shall act as a crucial support zone from short term perspective. On the downside 48000 is the crucial support from short term perspective. Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research, Religare Broking The recent consolidation in Nifty amid weak global cues indicates time-wise correction and traders should maintain a positive bias until the Nifty holds 22,200 level. However, stock selection is tricky in the prevailing scenario due to a mixed trend across sectors so traders should maintain extra caution on that part. Besides, one shouldn’t go overboard and restrict positions in quality midcap and smallcap names.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/analyst-call-tracker-global-specialty-strong-india-outlook-steer-optimism-for-sun-pharma-12566621.html,"Analyst optimism on the near-term prospects of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, India’s largest drugmaker, runs high, with the stock continuing to command the maximum ‘buy’ calls and the highest percentage of ‘buy’ calls. The optimism stems from Sun Pharma's strong presence in the global specialty space, where the company stands way ahead of rivals, and a robust outlook for its India business. Specialty drugs are medicines to treat chronic, complex, and rare diseases. The stock has consistently featured as one of the top pharma picks for most brokerages.Moneycontrol's Analyst Call Tracker shows that Sun Pharma has 34 'buy' calls from 41 brokerages that cover the company, taking the optimism for the stock to almost 83 percent. Only one brokerage has a 'sell' recommendation and six have a 'hold' rating. Sun Pharma’s better-than-expected financial results in the third quarter of FY24 ushered confidence among analysts. The company's US sales grew at a brisk pace while the India business remained strong. Consolidated net profit for Q3 jumped 16.5 percent on-year while revenue rose a little over 10 percent. Revenue from the US and India business as well as the global specialty segment grew in double digits. Global specialty portfolio Analysts are most optimistic over Sun Pharma's strong standing in the global specialty space, where rivals Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Cipla are yet to make an entry. The global specialty vertical, which makes up over 16 percent of the company's sales, also registered the strongest on-year growth of 24.2 percent in Q3. Analysts at ICICI Securities see wide room for growth in the segment. The drugmaker is likely to file for skin cancer drug Nidlegy in Europe in the second half of calendar year 2024, which will boost its specialty sales in the near term. Dilip Shanghvi, managing director of Sun Pharma, said the company will soon file for Nidlegy with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). ""Once approved, Nidlegy will significantly expand our onco-derm franchise in Europe,” Sanghvi said. Prabhudas Lilladher said the acquisition of Concert Pharmaceuticals, a US biopharmaceuticals company, along with progress in other drugs provide further visibility to Sun Pharma's specialty pipeline beyond FY25. The brokerage has Sun Pharma as its top pick in the sector. Strong domestic outlook Aside from the drugmaker's presence in the global specialty space, its strong performance in the domestic market has made analysts optimistic. Sun Pharma reported low double-digit growth in India in Q3, but ICICI Securities said new market representatives are helping Sun Pharma gain market share and boost volume growth. The company expanded its portfolio by launching 28 products in Q3, which stand to benefit from the growing network of medical representatives. Sharekhan raised its earnings-per-share target for Sun Pharma by 1-3 percent for FY25/26, backed by the continued traction in its specialty portfolio and dominant position in the Indian market. The drugmaker's shares have delivered close to 30 percent returns year-to-date as against the 12 percent rise in the BSE Healthcare index. The stock trades at a trailing 12-month PE of 43.64 times.

Such a move will ensure market stability and the welfare of farmers, the association's president, Ajay Jhunjhunwala, wrote in the letter. Currently, market prices of mustard are below the minimum support price of 5,650 rupees per 100 kg, and this necessitates immediate government intervention,the association said. On Thursday, prices in Jaipur were 5,475-5,500 rupees per 100 kg, according to traders. Minimum support price remains a concern, as the oilseed harvesting season is underway, SEA said.""Despite reaching a peak of 100 lakh (10 mln) hectares in acreage during the current season, mustard cultivation faces stagnation due to declining prices,"" it said. India has maintained a policy of free export of oilseeds, oilmeals, and edible oil alongside unrestricted import capabilities that affect the domestic market negatively. Excess imports have led to surplus inventory, posing a challenge to both the government and the industry. ""Import dependency for edible oils continues to escalate annually, with last year witnessing imports of 165 lakh tonnes (16.5 mln tn) valued at Rs. 1.4 lakh crores (1.4 trln rupees),"" he SEA said.

Volume in Tuesday's session was almost twice the average 30 days traded volume of the stock. With the stock trading well above its important moving averages, an immediate major support is placed at Rs 250 mark, below which the stock would lose its strength. Positional players are advised to keep a strict stop-loss at Rs 250 mark and aim for upside potential targets of Rs 302 and Rs 305 on the stock as this bullish momentum continues. We advise investors to maintain a hold and a buy-on-dips approach for the stock, with a strict stop-loss. Gujarat Pipavav Port The stock is approaching a crucial resistance zone of Rs 217-219 on its daily charts. With the volume on the stock being nearly 3 times its average 30 days traded volume, the momentum on the stock looks positive, and the stock looks poised for a good breakout above its crucial mark of Rs 220. A move above Rs 220 should trigger a fresh upside move towards Rs 240 and Rs 250 in the stock. An immediate support is expected to be placed at Rs 200 mark, below which the stock would lose its strength. We advise investors to maintain a hold and add aggressively above Rs 220 mark for the stock with a strict stop-loss.

The Bank Nifty encountered another round of volatility with the struggle between bulls and bears continuing unabated. Key support lies within the 46,000-45,800 zone, and maintaining these levels on a closing basis suggests a continued bullish stance. Immediate resistance is seen at 47,000, coinciding with the 20-DMA (day moving average), and a decisive close above this level could reignite the upward trend, targeting levels around 48,000-48,500.

Additionally, the RSI, in oversold territory, suggests a potential bounce from current levels. Key support is identified at Rs 257, serving as a cushion against downside risks, while upside targets are set at Rs 274 and Rs 280.

Oil turmoil The surge in crude oil prices has also put investors on edge. Both Brent and WTI crude went up more than 4 percent in the previous week, driven by expectations of a tighter market. The trend has continued this week, as both Brent and WTI prices climbed 2 in the previous session, reaching their highest levels since late October amid escalating geopolitical tensions and dropping crude exports.

Aquel is a 25-year-old brand with presence in western, central and certain parts of southern India. Aquel’s current promoters have sold the business to PRINCPIP due to financial stress. We believe this acquisition was necessary for PRINCPIP to have a manufacturing base in faucets, which is a pre-requisite for growing the bathware segment. As per PRINCPIP management, it can capitalise Aquel’s dealer mindshare by regular servicing. This acquisition is likely to boost PRINCPIP’s plans of being a notable player in the bathware segment.

Vinit Bolinjkar of Ventura Securities told Moneycontrol that aside from a positive manufacturing update from China, the commodities sector is at the start of a structural bull cycle, expected to last eight to 10 years. Another reason for the rise in metal prices is the global infrastructure thrust and increasing defence spends, which has spurred the demand for metals, Bolinjkar said.

The adjusted prices will cover more than 800 drugs on the National List of Essential Medicines. Price changes for scheduled drugs are allowed once a year. From April 2024, companies can take a 0.0055 percent hike. Every year, the National Pharma Pricing Authority (NPPA) announces a calculated ceiling of prices based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) of the previous calendar year. This limits the percentage hike drug companies can take on their portfolio under NLEM starting April. “Based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) data provided by the office of the Economic Advisor, Department of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the annual change in WPI works out as (+)0.00551% during the calendar year 2023 over the corresponding period in 2022,” the notification from the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) said. Essential medicines are those that satisfy the priority healthcare needs of a majority of the population. The essential medicines list needs to be country specific, addressing the disease burden of the nation and the commonly used medicines at primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare levels. The medicines in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) should be available at affordable costs and with assured quality. The NPPA regularly updates and maintains the list of products under NLEM. After annual increases of 12 percent and 10 percent in prices in 2023 and 2022, this will be a meagre increase for the industry. However, it might not be a big blow to the listed pharmaceutical players according to an expert. ““NLEM medicines are not a majority component of the Indian pharma companies;  the non-NLEM portfolio of the company has around roughly 80 percent and the NLEM portion in the domestic sales that we have is around 15 to 20 percent,” said Bhavesh Shah, Managing Director and Head-Investment Banking, Equirus. The Indian pharmaceutical market grew 6.8 percent in calendar year 2023. Price was a major growth factor in 2023 as volumes were down marginally by 0.9 percent.

The stock traded above all key moving averages. Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: Eicher Motors On the daily chart, we can see that stock has formed consolidation pattern. A close above Rs 4,015 level will confirm breakout of the said pattern. After which we can expect a good rise in this stock. On the below chart, we have also shown Bollinger Bands. Wherein, we can see that prices are currently trading close to the upper bands. Hence buying may emerge if prices close above the upper bands. In short, overall tone for Eicher Motors is bullish. Any close above Rs 4,015 is must for further bullish momentum to continue with the target of Rs 4,200. While on the downside, Rs 3,860 is the key support level.  Apollo Hospitals Enterprise On the daily chart, we can see the stock showed impulsive rise as per Elliott wave and now completed wave 2 near Rs 6,000 level. The up move can be wave 3 which can be strong and powerful. Also the stock has given a breakout from the consolidation pattern. On the below chart, we have shown MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicator, wherein, MACD line crossed above the MACD signal line and further break above 0 line will indicate rising momentum on upside. In short, trend for Apollo Hospitals is positive. We can expect a move to Rs 6,800 and probably higher as long as Rs 6,100 holds on the downside.  Symphony In the previous session, prices have given a close at the mid of Bollinger bands. A close above it with follow up action is must for further bullish momentum to continue. Also, volumes are picking up, which is a good signal. In short, the trend for Symphony is positive. A daily close above Rs 870 will confirm about positive trend reversal and then we can expect a rise towards Rs 895 levels. On the downside, Rs 820 remains the crucial support level.

NMDC, being the largest domestic iron ore miner, is expected to produce ~45mt of iron ore in FY24 (production for 11MFY24 has crossed 40.2mt), surpassing production of over 40mt for the third year in a row. It is well on track to exceed 50mt of production in FY25E and 55mt in FY26E. NMDC has planned capex for several evacuation and capacity enhancement projects, which should improve the product mix and augment its production capacity to ~100mt by FY29-30E. The domestic steel sector is well placed compared to its global peers and the domestic crude steel capacity is expected to reach ~175mt in FY24 with ~82% capacity utilization. This would translate to ~282mt of iron ore requirement in FY24E, with NMDC commanding a ~16% market share. Similarly, as crude steel capacity inches up to 300mt by FY30-31, total demand for iron ore would be ~435-445mt. We believe NMDC, with a dominant presence in the domestic market, is well placed to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead. Outlook NMDC trades at 4.5x FY26E EV/EBITDA and 1.7x FY26E P/B. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a TP of INR260. Key risks: 1) ~105 iron ore blocks have been auctioned since FY16 (~57 blocks auctioned in FY23 and FY24E) of which ~30 mines are operational; when the remaining captive mines become operational, it would lead to an increase in the supply of iron ore, thus increasing the competition for NMDC; 2) NMDC relies heavily on a few customers, which exposes the company to business risk.

Overall, we expect the market to consolidate in a broader range, however, buying in a broader market before the financial year end cannot be ruled out. Investors would watch for US Consumer confidence data to be released late today. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty is broadly trading in the range 21880- 22200 since the last three trading sessions. The range-bound action is likely to continue in the absence of any near-term triggers. Also, as we near the monthly expiry of the March series derivative contracts the volatility seems to have dried down resulting in to range-bound moves. The contraction of the hourly Bollinger bands also suggests sideway price action. Thus, multiple parameters are suggesting that Nifty is likely to witness subdued price action over the next few trading sessions. Stock specific action likely to continue during this period. Bank Nifty also consolidated within a narrow range around the key daily moving averages. On the downside 46500 is acting as a crucial support while 46900 is acting as an immediate hurdle. Overall, we expect the Bank Nifty to resume its retracement towards 47000 – 47200 over the next few trading sessions. The Bank Nifty index experienced a subdued start to the truncated week with sideways trading. Immediate resistance is noted at 47000, and a decisive close above this level could trigger significant short-covering rallies towards the 48000 mark. Conversely, immediate support is situated around the 46500-46450 zone. A breach below this support area may accelerate downside momentum towards the 46000 level. Investors resorted to profit-taking due to lack of enthusiasm in a truncated week. Markets were mostly range-bound with a negative bias as frontline technology stocks were at the receiving end on concerns that subdued global economy may lead to muted IT spending by big clients this year. Aligned with global trends, the domestic market sustained its consolidation pattern, ending close to 22,000. While key data such as US GDP and inflation during the week may provide some clues on future rate cut paths, the fiscal year-ending truncated week, coupled with reduced trading volumes and monthly expiry, are likely to contribute to volatility. Generally, midcaps are performing well post the consolidation of the last 2-3 weeks, while the IT sector continued to experience sluggishness following weak global IT spending forecasts. Nifty remained sideways throughout the day as market participants stayed perplexed on the first day of the holiday-shortened week. However, the trend remained positive for the short term as the index closed above the critical moving average on the daily chart. On the lower end, support is placed at 21,840 for the short term, below which weakness may emerge. On the higher end, resistance is visible at 22,240-22,300. Indian bourses began the truncated week on a tepid note and remained rangebound throughout the day to close the session at 22,004.70 with a loss of 92.05 points. Among the sectors, Realty was the top performer while Media was the major laggard followed by IT. Buying traction was seen more in the broader markets as Mid and Smallcaps gained by 1.05% & 0.41% and outperformed the Nifty50. On the hourly chart, it appears that the Index is forming an inverted head & shoulder formation where a level of 22,200 will be considered as a breakout point (neckline), and in that case, the target is 22,640. Indian rupee ended 13 paise higher at 83.29 per dollar versus Friday's close of 83.42. Indian equity indices snapped three day winning run and ended lower with Nifty at 22,000. At close, the Sensex was down 361.64 points or 0.50 percent at 72,470.30, and the Nifty was down 92.10 points or 0.42 percent at 22,004.70. About 1355 shares advanced, 2447 shares declined, and 122 shares unchanged. Bajaj Finance, Hindalco Industries, Britannia Industries, Adani Ports and L&T were among the top gainers on the Nifty, while losers were Power Grid Corporation, Eicher Motors, Bharti Airtel, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Wipro. On the sectoral front, bank and Information Technology index down 0.5 percent each, while capital goods, realty, oil & gas, metal up 0.5-1 percent.

Wonder how does it manifest in stock markets? Well, you have the tortoise stocks that are consistent. They're not fast, but keep inching ahead steadily. The hare stocks make big leaps and worn out soon. At the end of the story, the tortoise wins the race. In the midcap rally of FY24, which sent the BSE Midcap index simmering with 63 percent up, 23 stocks out of the 111 on the index, turned out to be multi-baggers that at least doubled in value. But only four stocks were the triumphant tortoise: Trent, Aurobindo Pharma, Lupin and Solar Industries. These stocks showed steady trades, low volatility or what is called ‘beta’ in high finance, compared with the market barometer Sensex, and yet at the end of the year, landed themselves in leading positions. Stocks with a beta higher than 1 are seen as more volatile than the index. Their rise is higher than that of the Sensex when it moves up and their fall is also deeper than the index when it falls. A stock with a beta value of less than 1 usually means that it will rise less than the benchmark on the way up, but also fall less on the way down.  Consistent performers The trajectory through the fiscal for all four stocks show remarkable consistency with three of them showing a steady climb all through the year without any significant drawdown. Only Solar Industries had a 5 percent decline. Also read:Higher returns with lower volatility: Select indices beat NSE Nifty 50 in past one year Over the past three years, all these three stocks showed a steady growth in the bottomline: 47 percent CAGR for Trent, 42 percent for Lupin and 41 percent for Solar Industries. Aurobindo Pharma, however, has shown a drop in net profit growth in this period. At a net profit of Rs 623.8 crore for the December quarter, Aurobindo Pharma recorded an uptick of 109 percent over the previous corresponding quarter. Its operating profit margins improved from 13.79 percent to 17.89 percent in the past 5 quarters. In spite of the steady price gains, Axis Direct has a 'buy' rating on the stock, given its stronger-than-expected earnings and future expansion plans. Motilal Oswal has a 'buy' tag on Trent on strong revenue productivity, aggressive store additions, margin tailwinds from moderating RM, and operating leverage. Net profits for Trent jumped 113 percent to Rs 343.6 crore in the December quarter of FY24 from Rs 161 crore a year back, while revenue increased 51 percent to Rs 3,389 crore from Rs 2,244 crore and operating profit margins improved  to 18.81 percent from 15.45 percent. Lupin’s net profit zoomed to Rs 916 crore in the December quarter from Rs 40.4 crore a year ago. IKts operating profit margins expanded to 29.58 percent from 7.52 percent and revenue jumped to Rs 4,138 crore from Rs 2,878 crore in the past 5 quarters. SBI securities is bullish on the stock, given its leadership in certain geographies, strong product portfolio and pipeline and strong quarterly results. Solar Industries saw its operating profit margins expand to 21.27 percent from 14.69 percent between the last two December quarters with the net profits jumping to Rs 138.3 crore from Rs 115.6 crore. Hem Securities has a 'buy' call on the stock as it believes the company is expected to perform well on the back of strong growth in exports and in overseas operations, steady demand from mining and infra sector and healthy execution in defence segment. Better performance from overseas subsidiaries on the back of strong demand, revenue increase from non-CIL customers in coal segment is expected even as defence and export segments are seen picking up due to diversified portfolio. On technical charts, all these four midcaps are indicating bullish signals. Darpan Patil of Rupic consultancy feels technical chart of Trent looks good and the shares are getting ready for the next leg of rally. According to Darpan, after a massive rally Trent is going sideways, also creating a flag chart formation. Bullish chart @ Trent

The company, also known as Narayana Health, received approval from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India to launch a health insurance business in India in January 2024. While acknowledging that the hospital-insurer combination could be seen as a conflict of interest, Narayana said its intention is to change the status quo. “We believe that we will be able to disrupt the way health services are consumed in the country,” said Sandhya. She emphasised the importance of health checkups that could reduce future hospitalisation expenses. Most health insurance providers cover only illnesses that require hospitalisation. Only a few provide cover for outpatient expenses such as doctor consultations and pharmacy spending. “We will have different products to cater to different segments of the population. Some of these will cover outpatient also,” Sandhya said. “Some products will focus on economical solutions targeting the missing middle (those who cannot afford insurance today), so we will cover across the spectrum.” Also read:India a main force in Asian Healthcare deal activity: Bain & Co Capex plans The company's capital expenditure was about Rs 1,000 crore in FY24, a level it hopes to maintain for the next few years. “We are expecting to spend in the same range - about Rs 1,000 crore - at least for the next few years because of the kind of expansion plan that we have targeted,” Sandhya said. Most of the spending in FY24 went into expansion of the company’s centre in the Cayman Islands. The centre is nearing completion and will have more daycare facilities. The capex for the next financial year will focus on India, according to the management. “Most of this expenditure will happen in India as Cayman expansion is complete,” Sandhya said. Narayana Hrudayalaya was allotted 7.26 acres of land in Kolkata on a freehold basis to set up a healthcare facility by the state housing infrastructure corporation in February 2024. The capex will focus on this site and the flagship hospital in Bengaluru. The company operates a chain of multispecialty, tertiary and primary healthcare facilities. Founded in 2000 by Devi Shetty, with over 30 years of medical experience, the group initially concentrated on cardiac and renal sciences and later expanded its scope to include cancer care, neurology, neurosurgery, orthopaedics, and gastroenterology. In 2013, the organisation rebranded itself as Narayana Health to better represent its diversified presence. With a significant presence in southern Karnataka and eastern India, it is gradually establishing itself in the western, central, and northern regions of the country. In February 2024, ICRA rated the company as stable. The stable outlook on the long-term rating reflects ICRA’s expectations that Narayana Health will continue to benefit from its strong market position, investments in technology and ramp-up of operations at new centres.

However, recent developments indicate a shift in momentum. In the current week, the index formed a lower-top-lower-bottom pattern along with a Doji pattern, but it managed to find strong support in the 21,800 – 21,750 range, indicating robust demand at lower levels. Moreover, the 13-week exponential moving average (EMA) has consistently acted as a support zone since November 2023, reinforcing the potential for an upward movement. A significant development is the Change in Polarity (CIP) formation observed at the 21,800 level on the daily scale, aligning with higher time frames. Key technical indicators, particularly the relative strength index (RSI), show positive readings above 60 on weekly and monthly intervals, while hovering around 50 and trending upwards on the daily scale, suggesting a favourable momentum. Looking ahead, immediate resistance levels are identified at 22,200, which holds pivotal importance on higher time frames, followed by resistance at 22,530. Crucial support levels are noted at 21,800 and 21,500. Based on the current chart patterns, a robust, bullish phase is anticipated for the longer term. It is advisable to consider buying opportunities above the 22,200 level, targeting potential upside levels ranging from 22,530 to 22,900. To effectively manage risks, it is prudent to implement a strict stop-loss strategy at 21,800 on a closing basis. Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks: Cummins India: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,898 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,672 | Target: Rs 3,340 | Return: 15 percent Despite broader market weakness, Cummins India is currently trading at its all-time high, displaying robust momentum by breaking a four-week range. Analysis on a weekly scale reveals a significant rally since November 2023, indicating a consistent upward trajectory. The stock has maintained its position above key averages such as the 12-weekly and 26-weekly averages, signalling a positive trend. Additionally, the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) study shows rising values in the positive territory, further reinforcing the bullish momentum. On the ratio chart against Nifty, a breakout from the 2015 swing pattern was observed in the recent week, suggesting strong outperformance. Looking forward, there is an anticipation of further price ascent towards Rs 3,340 mark. It is recommended to set a stop-loss at Rs 2,672, strictly based on the closing basis.  Sapphire Foods India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,583 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,457 | Target: Rs 1,900 | Return: 20 percent Sapphire Foods is showing notable relative strength, reaching new heights while the index tests key supports. The positive momentum is supported by robust volumes. This week, the stock broke through a crucial resistance zone that had previously seen multiple rejections, indicating a strong upward trajectory with significant volume participation. Sapphire maintains its position above key averages such as the 12-week and 26-week EMAs. The RSI study consistently remains above 60 across various timeframes, further reinforcing the breakout fuelled by a bullish momentum. Additionally, on the ratio chart comparing Sapphire against Nifty, a breakout from a sloping trend line suggests the beginning of an outperformance journey. Going ahead, we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 1,900, the bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 1,457 level.  BSE: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,243 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,064 | Target: Rs 2,703 | Return: 20 percent BSE demonstrates a robust price structure, characterized by a clear uptrend since March 2023, marked by consistent higher highs and higher lows. Following a healthy retracement from December 2023 after a sharp up move, the stock has now found support on the 30-week exponential moving average, indicating a mean reversion scenario.

Analysts suggest that these moves could help the company regain some of its competitive edge by offering a better experience to its users. However, they said the fundraise is too small to have a meaningful impact on the company's market share and its overall debt position. Furthermore, the board has approved only a part of the initial amount of Rs 45,000 crore planned by the company. “This will present a good opportunity for the vendors, including Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung, to get contracts at a time when fresh deals with Airtel and Jio will be limited,” Ashwinder Sethi, principal at Analysys Mason, told Moneycontrol.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/zomato-axis-bank-bharti-airtel-feature-on-jefferies-hotlist-for-next-5-years-12478451.html,"Brokerage firm Jefferies has shared a list of its top 11 picks with potential to deliver returns at a compounded annual growth rate of 15-25 percent over the next five years. The stocks, ranging across sectors, were selected based on two major themes -  strong fundamentals and long-term plays. With the US dollar clocking a CAGR of around 10-12 percent over the last 10 and 20 years, the Indian equity market is likely to reach $10 trillion in market valuation by 2030, Jefferies noted. The brokerage firm believes consistent and fast growing domestic flows will complement FPI inflows to sustain Indian market performance, especially for stocks with strong fundamentals. A revival in India's capex cycle, which has turned around from its FY20 bottom, should last more than five years as the housing and corporate capex cycle play out, Jefferies said. ""The capex cycle theme drives several of our top picks (Ambuja, Axis, JSW Energy, L&T, Macrotech). Other themes to play include government manufacturing push (Amber), state-owned enterprise reforms (SBI), penetration stories (Max Health, Zomato), financialisation of savings (Axis, SBI) and key consumer / bottom-of-pyramid ideas (Bharti, TVS)."" Let's take a look the 11 stocks that made it to Jefferies list of top picks. Amber Enterprises:Jefferies touted Amber Enterprises as the key beneficiary of India's manufacturing growth narrative, particularly within the small and midcap space. The company's core competency in ACs and diversification into components, supported by the government's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, is projected to drive a CAGR of 36 percent in earnings from 2024 to 2030. Ambuja Cements:As the second-largest cement producer in India, Ambuja Cements is expected to achieve strong operational performance compared to its peers. Factors contributing to the bullishness include the company's increased capacity, cost cutting and investments in green power, which combined are expected to drive 19 percent EBITDA CAGR. Axis Bank:Jefferies forecasts an earnings per share (EPS) CAGR of 18 percent for Axis Bank from 2024 to 2029. This growth trajectory is attributed to improvements in deposit franchises, ramp-ups in the digital and lending platforms, and the expansion of subsidiaries. The integration of Citibank India is also seen as a catalyst for cost and revenue synergies, while initiatives like hyper-personalisation platforms and loans for small and rural enterprises are expected to drive loan growth. Jefferies also sees potential for valuation re-rating. Follow our live blog for all the market action Bharti Airtel:Jefferies has a favourable opinion on Bharti Airtel due to its consistent market share gains and improving pricing environment, with room for growth in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). The brokerage expects a 12 percent to 13 percent CAGR in India revenue or EBITDA from 2024 to 2030, driven by market share expansion and higher ARPU. The generation of consistent free cash flow is seen as a factor that could lead to a shift in valuation benchmarks towards free cash flow yields, Jefferies believes. JSW Energy:Jefferies outlines three potential triggers for JSW Energy over the next 12-24 months, including increased visibility in renewable energy capacity, commissioning of a 700 MW merchant capacity during peak power demand, and progress on green hydrogen plants and energy storage batteries. The company's execution capabilities and prudent cash flow utilisation are expected to maintain elevated multiples and create shareholder value in the medium term. Larsen & Toubro:Jefferies identifies Larsen & Toubro (L&T) as a significant beneficiary of India's capital expenditure upswing, projecting a 25 percent EPS CAGR and an 18-20 percent return on equity (RoE). The potential for re-rating is also open given sustained EPS growth and shareholder-friendly capital allocation policies. However, risks include management's capital allocation decisions and government spending on infrastructure. Macrotech Developers:According to Jefferies,Macrotech Developers stands to benefit from the current housing capex cycle and its substantial land bank in Mumbai's suburbs. Jefferies expects a 15-20 percent medium-term pre-sales CAGR driven by land value resets and expansion into new geographies. Max Healthcare:Jefferies sees Max Healthcare as a potentially lucrative investment with sustained growth momentum in the hospital business. The brokerage expects a 20 percent average EBITDA growth rate from 2024-30, driven by new bed additions and efficient operations. However, the brokerage also sees some risks for the healthcare firm which include construction delays and overpriced acquisitions. State Bank of India:Jefferies has an optimistic view of the State Bank of India's (SBI) prospects, citing its strong deposit base, digital offerings, and leadership in lending segments. Alongside, the ability to raise capital and potential valuation re-rating are viewed as growth drivers. TVS Motor:Jefferies expects TVS Motor to benefit from the revival in Indian two-wheeler demand, narrowing profitability gaps with peers, and strong earnings growth prospects. However, the brokerage stands concerned over the company's investments in overseas entities with unclear strategies. Zomato:Jefferies considers Zomato as a compelling food delivery investment with strong growth potential and profitability. EBITDA break-even for Blinkit and visible profit pool growth over the next five years are key upside triggers, with capital allocation strategies being a key factor to monitor.

""FY24 marked a rewarding period for the Indian market. The upgrade in FY24 economy growth loaded it, as the Indian GDP forecast was uplifted on a QoQ basis from 6.4% to 7.3% during the year.

""As we move on to a new financial year, we express optimism towards sectors such as Pharma, Capital Goods, and Infra, as we see them as key growth drivers, supported by both domestic and external demand. Although some sectors like FMCG and IT are facing challenges due to subdued demand at present, we anticipate a turnaround, driven by expectations of a normal monsoon and increased US demand following the Fed's rate cut. However, the focus is on large caps, as the premium valuation of Midcaps could have a hiccup in the short to medium-term,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index added nearly 1 percent with 26 stocks gave double digit return including Sanghvi Movers, Bharat Bijlee, Technocraft Industries (India), Transformers and Rectifiers India, Manorama Industries, Aegis Logistics, Angel One, Schneider Electric Infrastructure, among others. However, EKI Energy Services, Sanmit Infra, Primo Chemicals, Jindal Poly Films, Dhani Services and OnMobile Global fell between 10-14 percent.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities The Nifty rallied significantly, surpassing the 22,500 mark after maintaining momentum beyond 22,100. Furthermore, there's a clear breakout in consolidation on the daily timeframe, signaling rising optimism. Nevertheless, the Nifty encountered initial resistance near its previous swing high of 22,526. Consequently, to sustain a continued rally, it must surpass the 22,525 level decisively. On the downside, 22,200 could serve as short-term support. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities While markets may witness wild fluctuations due to valuations of benchmark indices being in an expensive zone, the undertone still remains bullish as investors are willing to bet big on equity assets for the next financial year too. While focus will shift to full year earnings from next month, sectors like banking and IT companies will be in focus going ahead. Although corrections at every interval will provide investors an opportunity to revisit mid & small-cap stocks, large-cap stocks could attract more attention going ahead.

However, the company is likely to report double-digit volume growth in 4QFY24, supported by healthy demand and market share gains. We cut our EBITDA estimates by 4%/8%/8% for FY24/FY25/FY26 due to weak pricing, which was partly offset by higher volume growth and cost reduction initiatives. Further, a delay in the acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates (JPA)’s cement assets (announced in Dec’22) remains an overhang on the stock. The approval process from various banks is pending and is taking longer than anticipated. However, DALBHARA’s organic expansion plans are on track. It will add clinker and cement capacities of 4.9mtpa each through a mix of greenfield and brownfield expansions by FY25. Outlook The stock has corrected 15% in the last three months due to concerns of lower profitability because of a decline in cement prices. We value the stock at 12x FY26E (earlier 13x) EV/EBITDA to arrive at our revised TP of INR2,500 (earlier INR2,800). The stock offers an upside potential of 25% from current levels. Reiterate BUY.

The resistance zone is placed at 22,700-22,750, while support is at 22,600. A decisive move above 22,750 might induce a rally towards 23,000 in the short term. Since the market appears to be range-bound, buying on dips and selling on rallies might prove to be a good strategy with proper stop-loss measures.

This indicates enduring positive sentiment for the long term. On the weekly charts, the index bounced off significant support at the 13-week EMA (exponential moving average) following a brief correction, resuming its primary uptrend and setting a fresh record high after a three-week period. Additionally, a potential breakout of the cup-and-handle pattern is looming on the daily charts at the life-high level, suggesting an uptick in the bullish momentum. Key technical indicators, notably the relative strength index (RSI), are portraying optimistic readings above 60 across daily, weekly, and monthly time frames, indicating favourable momentum conditions. In terms of levels, immediate resistance is notable at 22,800, a significant level on higher time frames, with further resistance observed at 23,170 and 23,400. Conversely, crucial support levels are identified at 22,300 and 22,000. Considering the current chart patterns, a prolonged bullish phase is anticipated for the longer term. Consequently, it is advisable to seek buying opportunities at the current level, with potential upside targets ranging from 22,800 to 23,170. To mitigate risk effectively, implementing a strict stop-loss strategy at 22,300 on a closing basis is recommended. Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks: Ipca Laboratories: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,276 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,173 | Target: Rs 1,530 | Return: 20 percent Ipca Laboratories shows a robust structural development, characterised by a pattern of higher highs and higher lows since its strong turnaround from May 2023. Particularly noteworthy is its ability to sustain above the 78.60 percent key retracement level of its previous downward move (from Rs 1,371 to Rs 669), indicating potential for further upward momentum. The stock has consistently maintained levels above important moving averages such as the 12-weekly and 26-weekly, affirming a positive trend. Notably, its resilience is evidenced by its rebounds from the 12-weekly EMA, showcasing effective mean reversion dynamics. The RSI study remains above 60 across various timeframes, reinforcing the bullish momentum. When compared against the Nifty on a ratio chart, Ipca Labs continues to display outperformance, suggesting continued strength relative to the broader market index. Going ahead, we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 1,530. The bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 1,173 level. HEG: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,073 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,910 | Target: Rs 2,597 | Return: 25 percent HEG is currently trading at its 52-week high, reflecting robust momentum in its price structural development.

Presently, it is demonstrating robust momentum while retesting the breakout of a large triangular pattern, which spans approximately five years. This breakout holds significant importance and signifies the stock's potential to outperform. Additionally, HEG maintains its position above key moving averages such as the 20-week and 50-week EMAs, indicating a positive trend. The RSI study consistently remains above 60 across various timeframes, while both the ADX and +DI lines are above 30, reinforcing the bullish trend strength. Going ahead we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 2,597. The Bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 1,910 level.  City Union Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 154 | Stop-Loss: Rs 143 | Target: Rs 177 | Return: 15 percent The City Union Bank weekly chart reveals a consolidation phase, with recent indications of a turnaround from a support zone, potentially marking a sustained reversal. This reversal is supported by increased volume participation, evident from the surge above the crucial 21-week average. On the daily scale, the stock is establishing higher highs and higher lows, delineating a short-term uptrend that aligns with the broader timeframe. CUB is maintaining levels above key moving averages such as the 12-week and 26-week EMAs, signaling a trend improvement. The RSI above 60 and bullish crossovers further underscore the positive momentum. Looking ahead, it's reasonable to anticipate continued upward movement in the stock, with a potential target price of Rs 177. It's advisable to set a stop-loss at Rs 143 on a closing basis to manage risk effectively.

This boosts the confidence of investors in the company's asset quality and lending business. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action These companies typically charge interest rates on the loans they provide, and the difference between the interest earned on loans and the cost of funds represents their profit margin. When gold prices rise, the value of the collateral goes up, allowing them to maintain or even increase profit margins while lending against the same amount of gold. The loan-to-value ratio (LTV), representing the ratio of the loan amount to the value of the collateral (in this case, gold), also increases with a rise in price, allowing borrowers to access a higher percentage of the value of their gold as a loan, leading to loan growth for gold financiers.

This is in line with most managements’ observations on increasing manpower utilisation across IT firms as highlighted in Q3 earnings calls. In our opinion, this is a lead indicator for the much-awaited recovery in IT sector hiring. Non-IT sector hiring continues to be strong across infrastructure/ consumption/ services sectors. We think 99acres should turn profitable by Q1FY25E, aided by strong tailwinds in the underlying real estate sector.

The broader indices outperformed the benchmark, wherein smallcap gained over three percent while midcap closed higher by one and a half percent. We are now eyeing 22,700 in Nifty thus participants should maintain a “buy on dips” approach.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/india-among-biggest-losers-of-top-10-global-markets-in-march-as-smallcap-worry-hits-equities-12535251.html,"Indian equities have been one of the biggest losers among the top 10 global markets in March, hit by a decline in sentiment towards small and mid-cap stocks. Returns in dollar terms have also been lower because of a depreciation in the rupee. So far in March, India's aggregate market capitalisation dropped by 1.6 percent in dollar terms, marking the steepest fall since October 2023. The Indian equity market, however, maintained its fifth position globally with a market capitalisation of $4.5 trillion. The UK recorded the largest gains of 3.8 percent, followed by Canada and Japan with gains of 3.75 percent and 3.43 percent. The market value for the US and France expanded 2.66 percent and 1.84 percent, while Hong Kong saw a growth of 0.84 percent. Saudi Arabia suffered the sharpest decline of 2.13 percent, followed by India's 1.6 percent and China's 1.4 percent.  The domestic markets went into a correction in March after investors turned nervous about parking their money in midcaps and smallcaps, and liquidity challenges were hardened by operator activity. The recent ED raid on Hari Shankar Tibrewal and others involved in stock manipulation also thickened the air of caution in the broader market. Sebi's advisory to mutual funds regarding froth accumulation in smallcap and midcap schemes further impacted these stocks. On the currency front, the Indian National Rupee weakened around 0.6 percent against the US dollar in March. The markets, however, rebounded last week following a more dovish stance than expected from the US Federal Reserve, driving global indices to record highs and benefiting stocks. US Fed decided to maintain the interest rates aligned with market expectations. The decision was unanimous, reflecting the consensus among participants who see no immediate need for rate hikes. Highlights from the US central bank included a dovish outlook for the coming year, with the Fed retaining the projected three rate cuts for the year despite a strong labour market. Fed chair Jerome Powell noted a considerable easing of inflation but emphasised the need for a more sustainable slowdown in prices. After the recent spate of corrections, analysts foresee a base forming in indices. Many quality companies have hit key support levels. Investors should prioritise accumulating quality stocks for the long term. The ongoing consolidation is expected to pave the way for the next upward movement, with largecaps likely to outperform the broader market, analysts said. Emkay Research in its latest report said March correction offers a 6-12-month entry opportunity, driven by stretched valuations and small and midcap liquidity concerns. Despite the wobble, the economic fundamentals remained strong for India, with earnings growth continuing in FY25. Emkay Research expects a rebound in 3-6 months as smallcaps and midcaps outperform and largecap trade unwinds. Valuations remain mixed, with Nifty P/E moderate at 20x but small and midcap indices elevated at 29x and 25x. Small and midcaps rally persists due to economic shift towards manufacturing, offering volatile yet rewarding opportunities, said the brokerage. Emkay had in its January report said the Nifty would hit 24,000 by the end of December 2024. In its latest report it preferred smallcaps and midcaps and overweighting consumer discretionary, materials, and industrials. The brokerage bases its three-six-month projection on factors like anticipated BJP victory in the general elections next month, a reform-oriented budget in July, and monetary easing by the Reserve Bank of India. Foreign brokerage Jefferies said it sees the recent decline in midcaps and smallcaps as just a correction, and not a meltdown like 2018. Despite potential further corrections due to increased volumes and mutual fund flows, it views this as healthy. It remains bullish on sectors like property development, industrial and power, and select PSUs. Unlike 2018, this correction isn't worsened by a crisis, and macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong. Inflows to smallcaps and midcaps have moderated, though volumes remained high, signalling potential for further correction, it said.

He says one should not be under-exposed to largecaps at this point as valuations are much more attractive, compared to small caps. On real estate, he said if one has faith in the economic growth and corporate expansion, one cannot afford to be pessimistic about real estate. Somaiyya recommends a 20 percent allocation to gold for retail investors planning to build a balanced asset-allocated portfolio. Edited Excerpts: Global cues are turning unfavourable with US yields and dollar inching higher and June rate cut bets cooling off. Do you expect global factors to play spoilsport or is a pre-election rally still on the table? It seems to have become fashionable to say that election results are fully discounted and that budgets are like a non-event, etc, etc. Considering the statements that are coming from the leadership , it would be unwise to underestimate the impact of the upcoming elections and the impending full-year budget. There's always anticipation surrounding such events, and markets thrive on expectations about their outcomes. Looking back over the past couple of years, it is evident that the market has remained largely range-bound, oscillating between various levels, such as 18,500, 19,000, 18,000, 16,700, and 17,700. Despite this, there have been shifts in sectoral performance, with periods of outperformance by different segments like largecaps, smallcaps, financials, IT, PSUs, metals, commodities, and energy. Markets were navigating concerns surrounding geopolitical issues, US policy uncertainties, and domestic political landscape at that time. However, recent developments, such as a clearer political landscape in India and a pause in US interest rates, have altered the landscape. Fundamentals have shown signs of improvement, accelerating in the last six months. Given these shifts, it appears that many have taken the market for granted. In my opinion, there is substantial upside potential in the coming months, which shouldn't be overlooked or underestimated. Also Read:Analyst Tracker: Banking, finance stocks continue to be analysts’ darlings Do you believe that the recent rebound in mid- and small-cap indices indicates that the correction phase is over, or do you think there's still froth to be cleared? I think the market will always work on relative value. As long as the economic conditions and the underlying feeling is bullish, there would be an uptrend. In that journey, it's very normal that, at certain points, certain sectors and market caps will do well. When they get stretched, people will look for where the relative value is. For example, just a couple of months ago, I read a report from one of the leading brokerage houses that there is now value in quality. It just suggests that the market tends to rotate from something which gets expensive in favour of something which might look relatively attractive. So, as long as there is no breakdown or change in sentiment and the economic conditions remain stable, I think this bullishness would persist. In March, while the small-cap index experienced a decline, the BSE 500 index, as a whole, remained relatively flat. This indicates that largecaps may have outperformed smallcaps during that period. Additionally, analysing the fund flows over recent months reveals that inflows predominantly originated from retail investors, high  net-worth individuals (HNIs), and domestic mutual funds. But, if there is any pivot in US policy a couple of months down the line, you might see the colour of money change and foreign inflows may actually turn positive. So, as long as there is a bullish trend, we should all be constructive. At different points in time, different market caps or different sectors will take the lead. Since largecaps have just about started performing well, would you advise investors to move out of mid-cap funds and increase exposure to large-cap funds? Whenever anybody says that smallcaps and midcaps have become expensive, investors generally start assuming that there is a big crash coming in them. I don't think anybody's predicting a crash . I think the case is being made only for relative performance. So, with that caveat, I would like to clarify that, yes, one does expect largecaps to outperform smallcaps and midcaps over the next six months. But that message is only to the extent of outperformance. So, I don't think that small and mid caps are going to crash or yield negative returns, but they could just lag largecaps. Frankly, long-term investors should not be changing their allocation based on short-term outlooks. But yes, for those who are on the ball and managing things actively, they should, at least, look to ensure that they are not too underweight on largecaps or too overly exposed to smallcaps. Your exposure should definitely tilt more in favour of largecaps at this point because relative value is what will always rule the markets. Also Read:India stocks @ Rs 400 trillion: What caused the last Rs 100 trillion swell What is your take on defence PSUs, given the run-up in stock prices? The popular view is that they still have meaningful upsides because of government initiatives for self-reliance and export promotion. Do you agree? If I were to actually second-guess these kind of pronouncements, it's coming partly from two things. Over the last 2-3 years, defence has been the buzzword and has been on the top of mind because of geopolitics. On top of that, the government is looking to indigenise and invite investments for the right reasons. And the third and most appreciable thing is the way we are managing the public sector enterprises. In the past, for public sector enterprises, the buzzword was disinvestment and then privatisation. But today, the government is using state-owned enterprises as an instrument of policy action and to drive investments in the economy. So clearly that is more constructive. So I would not disagree if somebody says that public sector enterprises and defence would be in play. You should also be mindful that there is an election coming up, followed by a big-bang budget which could put a plan in place for the next 25 years. So one can't take it lightly. However, it's important to have a balanced perspective. So, I would also warn investors to keep in mind when something becomes a theme or a buzzword, one must exercise caution. So go stock-specific, go bottom up, but be constructive on the market. That's what I would say. As far as PSUs or state-owned enterprises are concerned, they are across sectors. So there as well, one should adopt a bottom-up approach. How do you suggest investors should approach the real-estate sector, considering its strong performance in FY24? Would you recommend investing in individual stocks, REITs, or direct real estate purchases? I've always been a staunch believer in real estate. Personally, I ensure that my investment portfolio includes both real estate and equity. Over the past decade, the real-estate sector has undergone significant structural changes. I would argue that if you have faith in economic growth and corporate expansion, you cannot afford to be pessimistic about real estate. Therefore, I see long-term growth potential in real estate investments. Of course, it's essential to be discerning about where you invest. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are an excellent option because they offer a hybrid investment vehicle. However, to make informed decisions, you need a deep understanding of the underlying asset class. Whether it's commercial properties, infrastructure like ports and highways, or other types of real estate, you must grasp the nuances of each. This includes understanding usage patterns, occupancy rates, and other factors. For instance, if you're investing in commercial real estate-backed REITs, you should monitor trends in occupancies, project developments, and interest rates. REITs shouldn't be viewed simply as quasi-debt instruments; they are hybrids that require thorough analysis just like equity investments. But all in all, I would say that I would be constructive and again not get caught by what has been the popular belief in the last decade. Given the recent inclusion of Indian bonds in global indices, do you recommend adding debt funds to portfolios, and if so, what percentage allocation would you advise? Debt funds are an essential component of investment portfolios, catering to both conservative investors and those averse to the high volatility of equity markets. Additionally, individuals with short-term financial goals, such as those expected within the next year or two, typically allocate a portion of their portfolios to fixed income assets. In the current context, particularly following the pause in US monetary policy and anticipated rate hikes, there is anticipation of a pivot in US policy. This potential shift is significant as it could alleviate pressure on our currency and external macroeconomic indicators. I think a pivot in US policy is something to watch out for because that would probably result in some driving-down of rates, and, hence, appreciation in bond portfolios. Additionally, the increasing foreign investment in Indian bonds, driven by expectations of inclusion in bond indices, is another noteworthy trend. There is potential for appreciation from time to time, the secondary market is already showing that. So my sense is that, over the next 12-18 months, there is potential for appreciation from time to time and the secondary market is already showing that. So, one should consider having a longer duration in the portfolios, at least a 12-18 month time horizon. Also Read:Daily Voice: This chief investment officer explains why he is bullish on gold prices that hit a new high Does it make sense investing in gold at these prices? Even for equity investors, asset allocation remains crucial, as it ensures a balanced portfolio that includes both fixed income and equities. While fixed income serves as a buffer for emergencies and short-term goals, gold plays a unique role in mitigating volatility, particularly during challenging market phases. During periods of market turmoil, which occur roughly every 5-10 years, gold acts as a hedge against downside risk, stabilising portfolio volatility. Despite potential currency appreciation counteracting some of its benefits, gold retains its significance in a well-diversified portfolio. In fact, gold has historically provided double-digit returns, even amid market highs, making it indispensable for conservative investors. To effectively leverage gold's volatility-reducing potential, it's essential to allocate a reasonable portion of around 20 percent in the portfolio. This ensures meaningful risk mitigation, unlike smaller allocations that have minimal impact on volatility reduction. If you have 50-60 percent in equities and just 5 percent in gold, it doesn't help in reducing volatility. Therefore, a 20 percent allocation to gold is advisable for any retail investor planning to build a balanced asset-allocated portfolio.

The sentiment may continue to remain sideways due to the lack of a directional breakout or pattern formation. At the higher end, 22650 might prove to be a crucial resistance level. A fresh rally is not anticipated as long as the index remains below 22650. On the lower end, support is evident at 22300; if breached, the index might decline towards the 22000-21900 range. Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas The Nifty opened on a weak note and consolidated during the day. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty consolidated and traded within the range of the previous trading session. The Nifty appears to be consolidating after a sharp run-up which is a healthy sign. We expect the consolidation to breakout on the upside and thus minor degree corrections should be bought into. On the upside we expect levels of 22700 which is the upper end of the rising channel. On the downside crucial support is placed at 22400 – 22350. As far as Bank Nifty is concerned, it has been outperforming and we expect the outperformance to continue. On the upside the immediate hurdle is placed at 48636 and above that the rally is likely to continue till 49300. The zone of 47700 – 47500 shall act as a crucial support zone from short term perspective. On the downside 48000 is the crucial support from short term perspective.

To sustain the growth momentum, VBL has adopted a multi-pronged strategy for CY24, wherein it will focus on enhancing its manufacturing capability (to rise ~45% over CY22 capacity; and the capacity for dairy and juices set to triple), bolstering its distribution network (~3.8m retail outlets in CY23 vs. ~3m in CY22), and improving its geographical reach (domestically as well as internationally). Considering this incremental capacity, improved network, and newer geographies (include acquisition of BevCo), we expect VBL to sustain its strong revenue growth momentum over CY24-CY26 (est. ~21% CAGR over the period).  Within the international market, VBL has signed an exclusive agreement to manufacture and package Cheetos in Morocco.

Long-term support in Nifty is expected at 21,500 followed by 21,300, with resistance at 22,200. Meanwhile, Bank Nifty has seen seven red consecutive trading sessions and is just holding above 100 DMA. Private banking stocks are struggling to provide support while the Nifty PSU Index weakens on the weekly chart.

It, however, failed to close above its previous all-time high of 22,526.60, which raises concerns for the current week. The Nifty is trading above the S3 Camarilla pivot (22,346), and it found support at this level in the previous trading session. Additionally, since the Nifty is trading significantly above its 21-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (DEMA), there is a possibility of reversion towards the next support levels of 22,340 and 22,200. Overall, the levels to watch out for on the higher side would be 22,600 - 22,800 and lower side 22,200–22,000. The Nifty Bank index emerged as a notable performer in the past week, gaining almost 1,368 points and closing with a substantial increase of 2.90 percent for the week. Looking ahead, the level of 48,636 poses an immediate resistance as it represents the previous high reached in December 2023. Coincidentally, the 48,600 mark aligns with R5 Camarilla resistance, which could prompt some investors to book profits, potentially leading to a pullback in the Nifty Bank index towards its immediate support levels of 48,000 and 47,500. Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks: Orient Cement: Buy | LTP: Rs 217 | Stop-Loss: Rs 195 | Target: Rs 250 | Return: 15 percent Following a peak near the Rs 293 level, Orient Cement encountered a notable downturn, marked by a sharp decline of 35 percent in its overall value. Despite this downturn, Orient Cement has shown signs of stability around Rs 200 level for the week, establishing a sustained support base. It's noteworthy that Rs 190-200 level coincides with Fibonacci ratio clustering, as indicated in the chart. Moreover, during this period, a 1:1 leg has also formed around this support zone, further reinforcing a bullish sentiment in the stock. Analysis of the daily scale RSI (relative strength index) indicator reveals a bullish hidden divergence, suggesting a favourable outlook for Orient Cement. Taking into account these factors along with chart patterns, investors may find it prudent to consider initiating buy positions within the range of Rs 210-220, with an upside objective targeted at Rs 250. To manage risk effectively, it's advisable to set a stop-loss order at Rs 195 on a daily closing basis, providing protection against potential downside movements.  Hindustan Unilever: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,266.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,145 | Target: Rs 2,500 | Return: 10 percent Since reaching its peak around Rs 2,669 mark on January 1, 2024, Hindustan Unilever has experienced a notable downturn, witnessing a significant decline of 16 percent. However, in the subsequent six trading sessions, Hindustan Unilever has displayed resilience, avoiding further declines and instead consolidating within a range spanning from Rs 2,230 to Rs 2,280. Notably, within this price range, a bullish AB=CD pattern has formed on the daily chart of Hindustan Unilever. This range also corresponds with the 0.50 percent retracement level of a price swing observed between March 2022 and July 2023, as depicted on the chart. Additionally, on a daily scale, the relative strength index (RSI) has exhibited a complex structure (W shape) along with some regular bull divergence on the 4-hour chart. Interestingly, the mentioned range of Rs 2,230-2,280 aligns with S3 weekly Camarilla Pivot, suggesting a potentially attractive buying opportunity. Therefore, it might be prudent to consider buying within the range of Rs 2,250-2,280, aiming for an upside target of Rs 2,500, while setting a stop-loss near Rs 2,145 on a daily closing basis.  AU Small Finance Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 634.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 585 | Target: Rs 725 | Return: 14 percent AU Small Finance Bank reached a peak around Rs 813 on January 9, 2024, but then experienced a decline of about 32 percent. However, in the past two weeks, the stock has shown a significant recovery and is currently trading near Rs 620 mark, indicating a bullish sentiment. On the indicator side, the weekly Scale Stochastics indicator has identified a ""hidden Bull Divergence"" close to its previous low point recorded on March 20, 2023 (as shown on the chart). This divergence suggests the possibility of upward momentum and indicates a potential bullish sentiment. Therefore, investors may consider adding long positions in the range of Rs 620-640, with an upside target set at Rs 725. It's recommended to set a stop-loss near Rs 585 on a daily closing basis to manage risk.

This comes after South Korean auto majors Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) and Kia Corporation announced a partnership with the homegrown battery maker for electric vehicle battery localisation in the country.

Support as per this comes near Rs 2,910 levels. As long as the price trades above it, further buying can be seen. In the below chart, we have also shown Bollinger Bands, wherein prices reversed from the mid-bands and moved up. So, with follow-up buying, we can expect a move towards upper bands in the coming weeks which is near Rs 3,400 levels. In short, the overall tone for Godfrey Phillips is bullish. A breach above Rs 3,190 is a must for further bullish momentum to continue with the targets of Rs 3,310 followed by Rs 3,400 levels. On the downside, Rs 2,910 is the key support level.  Linde India Linde India has been moving higher recently and intact in a strong uptrend. On the daily chart, the price has closed above Rs 6,765 level which confirms the breakout of the rounding bottom pattern. We have shown the ADX (average directional index) indicator which gives an indication if the stock is trending or in a trading range. The low readings of ADX indicate that the stock is in a range. The ADX of this stock is 35.02 giving an indication of a trending market. A reading above 25 means strong directional strength. In short, the trend for this stock is positive. Use dips towards Rs 6,680-6,730 as a buying opportunity for a move towards Rs 7,400-7,500 levels as long as Rs 6,350 holds on the downside.  PI Industries In the below chart, we can see that the stock reversed from the important support which was near Rs 3,715 levels. After which prices crossed above the EMA (exponential moving average) trend cloud indicator, and since then prices managed to sustain above it.

However, equity analysts expect the trend to reverse going into the next financial year 2024-25 as large-cap stocks may reclaim momentum, while Sebi's concerns of 'frothy' valuations and mutual funds' stress test results cast a shadow on small-cap stocks. Indian equity markets had exhibited a stellar performance in FY24, backed by accommodative monetary policy, strong domestic retail participation, corporate earnings, and economic recovery post pandemic blues. From 16,900 to 22,500, benchmark Nifty 50 climbed over 27 percent in FY24, while Sensex surged over 23 percent. Market experts expect the bull trend in large cap stocks to remain intact going ahead even as some uncertainty owing to 2024 general elections may worry investors. Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice-President of Technical Research at Religare Broking, expects Nifty to surge up to 25,500 in financial year 2024-25 (FY25) supported by heavyweight stocks. However, on the downside, he underlined a strong support of 19,500-20,000 for Nifty.  Broader markets widely outperform Nifty, Sensex On the broader-end of markets, the Nifty Smallcap 100 and Nifty Midcap 100 indices have outperformed benchmarks by rising 69 percent and 59 percent, respectively in FY24. But experts believe that this trend would change going forward, given market regulator Sebi's concerns on 'frothy' valuations in these segments and mutual funds stress test results. ""Smallcaps, especially, are likely to receive a backlash in FY25 as Sebi may ramp up scrutiny over this segment due to stretched valuations. We expect smallcaps and smaller midcaps to see moderation in gains going ahead,"" warned VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist of Geojit Financial Services. Where to invest for FY25 Sectorally, Nifty Realty index was the top winner in FY24 as it gave triple-digit returns (131 percent), followed by Nifty India Defence, Nifty PSE, Nifty CPSE, and Nifty PSU Bank indices.  For FY25, Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services expects Nifty PSU Bank index to take the lead, while the realty stocks could see some moderation as most positives are already priced-in. On the flipside, Nifty Media, Nifty Private Bank, and Bank Nifty were among the top sectors that saw modest gains in FY24.

Similarly, the average daily turnover for derivatives decreased by 8.76 percent to Rs 373.44 lakh crore, marking the sharpest fall since April 2021, from Rs 409.27 lakh crore in February.   ""Average turnover in the cash segment in March fell compared to February due to the correction in the overall market from the second week of March and even sharper correction across the small and midcaps. The average turnover in derivatives fell as apart from the above reason, bounce in the third week of March was patchy among the F&O stocks. Also year-end considerations meant that the overall positions were reduced during the course of the month,"" said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities. Indian markets saw a downturn due to concerns over mid and small cap stock valuations raised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, dampening investor sentiment and reducing participation in mid and small cap stocks, analysts said. In March, the Sensex and the Nifty gained 1.6 percent each, while the BSE Smallcap and the BSE Midcap indices fell 0.6 percent and 4.55 percent. Shrey Jain, founder and chief executive of SAS Online - India's Deep Discount Broker, believes that the investor participation should improve going forward. The S&P500 index hitting a new lifetime high in the US will have a positive effect on Indian equities as well. Foreign portfolio investors have exhibited keen interest in Indian equities in March. If the money flows continue, then it will be supportive for stock prices, Jain added. Last week, markets surged on a more dovish stance from the US Federal Reserve, driving global indices to record highs and boosting stocks. The Fed's decision to maintain interest rates met market expectations unanimously, signalling no immediate need for rate hikes. Despite a robust labour market, the Fed retained its projected three rate cuts for the year, emphasising the importance of a sustainable slowdown in inflation. Several analysts anticipate a base forming in indices after recent corrections, with quality companies hitting key support levels. They recommend accumulating quality stocks for the long term, foreseeing ongoing consolidation paving the way for the next upward movement, particularly in largecaps. Analysts further said that in the run up to the elections, the Nifty50 index should remain in a narrow range with an upward bias. If the Nifty crosses the previous life high of 22,526, then it should touch 22,800 where it may face some resistance. Outcome of the monetary policy review by the Reserve Bank of India will be watched keenly to take cues about liquidity management and impending cuts in policy interest rates. Traders should focus on largecap stocks and maintain stop loss, they added. Nuvama Research advises turning bullish after the recent spate of corrections in midcaps and smallcaps, seeing it as part of an ongoing bull market. They suggest taking long positions, noting oversold conditions at key support levels. With the broader market cooling down and largecaps experiencing corrective phases without any major impact on Nifty50, they anticipate a favourable risk premium for long positions, buoyed by strong global market trends, upcoming earnings seasons, and impending general elections.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hot-stocks-heres-why-you-should-pick-icici-pru-life-and-piramal-pharma-for-short-term-12551201.html,"The Nifty closed at 22,327 with a respectable gain of over a percent for the week ended March 28. A bullish sentiment prevailed on the market throughout the week, reflecting an overall improvement in the broader market mood. The correction observed in mid-March appears to have concluded, with prices closing above the key resistance levels, signalling a resumption of the primary uptrend. Additionally, the RSI Smoothened indicator that recently witnessed a dip has turned northward and hints at a fresh 'buy' call. Going ahead to the week starting April 1, close attention will be paid to the all-time high levels above 22,500, as hesitation was evident at these levels. A sustained trade or close above this point would confirm the resumption of the primary uptrend, potentially triggering a further rally in April. Conversely, buying on dips remained a notable pattern during the week, suggesting that 22,200 serves as an immediate support, while 22,000 and 21,700 represent subsequent key support levels. Notably, 22,500 and then 22,680 stand as significant hurdles on the upside. Traders are advised to monitor these levels closely and adjust their strategies accordingly. While midcap and small-cap sectors showed improvement during the truncated week, the primary contribution came from heavyweight stocks. Going ahead, although the uptrend may continue, traders must exercise selectivity in their approach, as index management is anticipated. Here are two buy calls for the short term: ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 609 | Stop-Loss: Rs 579 | Target: Rs 670 | Return: 10 percent Over the past two years, stock prices have consistently encountered substantial resistance around Rs 600 level. However, they have now decisively breached this barrier, confirming a robust breakout known as the 'Inverse Head and Shoulders' pattern. This breakout, evident on the weekly chart, is accompanied by a notable increase in trading volume and the presence of strong bullish candlesticks. Furthermore, the daily chart indicates a compelling moving average crossover, with the 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) surpassing the 200-day SMA (simple moving average) from below. Taking into account these technical parameters, we hold a firmly bullish outlook on this stock. Hence, we recommend buying ICICI Prudential at around Rs 609 - 600, with a stop-loss of Rs 579 and target of Rs 670.  Piramal Pharma: Buy | LTP: Rs 129 | Stop-Loss: Rs 123 | Target: Rs 138 | Return: 7 percent Following a robust surge from Rs 88 to Rs 149, the stock experienced a healthy correction over the past few months. However, after retracing approximately 50 percent of this rally, prices have begun to exhibit positive momentum once again. Notably, the recent correction occurred on low volumes, while upticks have been accompanied by comparatively higher volumes, indicating accumulation in this stock. Moreover, prices have closed above the 20, 50, and 89 EMA on a single daily candle, a rare and strong bullish signal. Additionally, the momentum oscillator RSI (relative strength index) has recently issued a buy signal in the oversold zone, further supporting the bullish outlook. Considering all these factors, we maintain a positive stance on the stock. Hence, we recommend buying Piramal Pharma at around Rs 129 - 127, with a stop-loss of Rs 123 and target of Rs 138.

This is because consumer companies are planning to invest more in advertising and promotion to boost sales volumes,"" they added. The brokerage expects HUL, Marico, Godrej Consumer, and Colgate to see major gross margin gains in the March quarter. Market experts said rural demand recovery was a must for FMCG sector's growth. ""Reviving rural demand is crucial for the FMCG sector, with companies pinning hopes on a favourable monsoon, which could stimulate the rural economy,"" analysts at Elara Capital said. So far this year, the Nifty FMCG index has declined more than 5 percent against a 4 percent rise in the Nifty.

On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty is inching towards 22200 – 22215 where multiple resistance parameters are placed. We believe that the retracement rally has more steam left and we expect the momentum to continue.

Crude price touched a four-month high amid Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries and OPEC supply cuts and is nearing $87 a barrel. Lower crude exports from Iraq, Saudi Arabia and signs of stronger demand and economic growth in China and the US has also pushed crude prices higher. These Russian outages and extended OPEC+ output cuts have pushed Morgan Stanley to raise its Brent oil price forecasts by $10 to $90 for the third quarter of 2024. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Rising prices may strain OMCs like Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) as they face higher costs in sourcing crude for refining into petrol and diesel. As crude prices surge, OMCs may find it challenging to fully pass on the cost hikes to consumers, given government regulations or market competition. The government’s recent decision to slash petrol and diesel prices by Rs 2 a litre, combined with escalating crude prices could further squeeze OMCs' profit margins. Motilal Oswal expects a negative stock price reaction for OMCs in the near term, given the retail price cut and recent elevated Brent crude prices. The brokerage has a “buy” rating on HPCL and IOCL and a “neutral” call on BPCL. As the impact of the Red Sea crisis on crude oil and refining GRMs wanes, marketing margins can recover to above Rs 3, the brokerage said. Morgan Stanley said the auto fuel price cut should finally remove key overhang. The brokerage prefers Indian Oil, which has the highest refining exposure. ""HPCL may see a negative near-term impact on integrated margins and one should look to accumulate the stock on corrections,"" Morgan Stanley said. On the contrary, CLSA has a “sell” call on all three leading OMCs-HPCL, BPCL and IOC. ""Margin on diesel is now below fair levels and this cut challenges the optimistic narrative of the government. Stock price baking in much higher than long-term average refining and marketing margins,"" it added. Also Read |Oil prices edge down as Russia lifts supplies, jet fuel demand stirs caution Stocks of paint manufacturers like Akzo Nobel India, Berger Paints, Indigo Paints, and Shalimar Paints may also come under pressure. as crude derivatives are key raw materials for them, accounting for almost 40 percent of the input bill for paint manufacturers. A rise in the price of crude can mean narrower profit margins. Upstream oil exploration firms like ONGC benefit from higher crude prices.

Only infrastructure, realty, healthcare and commodity indices are ahead of Nifty MNC index so far in 2024. When we look at the composition of the Nifty MNC index, we find that after the FMCG sector which has a total weightage of over 31.5 percent in the index, it is the capital goods sector that constitutes over 21.5 percent weightage of the index. Also read:Investors get the whiff of higher value in high dividend yielding small-cap stocks Capital goods constituents of Nifty MNC index such as Bosch, Cummins India, Siemens and ABB have contributed handsomely to the gains of the Nifty MNC index so far this year.  Cummins India, which carries a weightage of 2.74 percent in the Nifty MNC index, is up nearly 50 percent on a year-to-date basis, underperforming only the top index gainer Oracle Financials, which surged 99 percent in the same period. Bosch, with a weightage of 3.16 percent in the index, is up around 36 percent, ABB India 27 percent with 4.49 percent weightage in the index, and Siemens with weightage of 6.3 percent is up by 24 percent. Another common feature that links these capital goods multinational stocks is that they are almost zero-debt companies. We find that the debt-free capital goods MNCs have largely outperformed the Nifty returns.  Capital goods outperformance The capital goods sector has been doing well because of the various government initiatives towards incremental capex spending. The chart below explains the outperformance of BSE Capital Goods Index over BSE Sensex in the previous five years. The BSE Capital Goods index has delivered almost double the returns of the BSE Sensex in this period.  Also read:Bajaj Auto turns the Hero of Nifty pack over last one year for consistencyExperts take on capital goods sector The important question from the investor’s point of view is whether the growth is behind the capital goods sector or the momentum is not over yet. Anand Rathi believes that private capex will drive the next leg of growth for the capital goods sector. The brokerage house in its research report published on March 22, picked Cummins for a 'buy' tag, while Siemens and ABB enjoy a 'hold' status. The brokerage house is bullish on the power generation business of Cummins India because of its superior technology and reach that outsmart its peers. The report highlights that the demand is robust in data centres, commercial and residential realty, infrastructure and manufacturing, allowing it to build in a 23 percent CAGR expectation over FY23-26 for its powergen business. On Siemens, Anand Rathi believes the company is a key beneficiary of the many macro themes currently unfolding in India. These include digitisation, sustainability, infra upgrade and modernisation. ABB, according to the brokerage firm, like Siemens, is a key beneficiary of the unfolding macro themes and ongoing capex. ABB’s strength lies in electrification and automation and hence the stock carries a 'hold' recommendation. Given the underlying strength of the capital goods sector in India and the high quality of the MNC businesses, debt-free multinationals will be on long-term watch lists of investors.

Domestic institutions continued to be net buyers, investing around Rs 52,467 crore in the market to hit a four-year high.  Outside India, South Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia were the investment destinations for FIIs, while they chose to pull out money from markets in Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. South Korea received inflows of $2.91 billion, Taiwan $1.14 billion and Indonesia $585 million. The Japanese market recorded the biggest FII outflow of $5.35 billion, followed by Thailand and Malaysia at $1.13 billion and $514 million. In Vietnam, the outflow reached $197 million, and $40 million in the Philippines. Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities, attributed the net FII figures to purchases of stocks through block deals and index rebalancing in March. A steep correction in the market also threw up an opportunity to buy undervalued stocks, including small and mid-caps. For DIIs, cash reserves helped raise their equity holdings. With March being the year-end month, investors try to book fresh positions and clean up their books. This also fuelled the buying binge, according to him. March witnessed significant block trades, including BAT Plc selling its stake in ITC for Rs 17,485 crore, Rakesh Gangwal divesting in Interglobe Aviation for over Rs 7,800 crore, Tata Sons selling off around 1 percent stake in Tata Consultancy Services for Rs 9,000 crore, and Singtel diluting its stake in Bharti Airtel for Rs 5,849 crore. Gaurav Misra, Head - Equity at Mirae Asset Investment Managers, said Domestic institutions have been buyers and FIIs sellers in aggregate, except for MSCI-related rebalancing. Domestic mutual funds and possibly AIF have been sitting on cash which would have been deployed in stocks where they have bottom-up comfort. This is despite some cohorts of the market being at a premium.  So far in March, the benchmark Sensex and Nifty indices lost 0.1 percent each, while BSE MidCap and SmallCap declined 0.7 percent and 5.53 percent. The correction in the Indian markets were triggered by factors such as ED raids on a major market player, Sebi warning about market froth, concerns about liquidity stress tests by mutual funds, and fears of RBI intervention against stock market inflows. Analysts said that despite the buying binge of the institutional investors, liquidity has dried up after recent actions by the RBI and enforcement agencies, impacting market operators and HNIs reliant on leverage. They added that NBFCs were reassessing lending against shares, reducing the overdraft facilities for HNIs. This forced liquidation of positions, triggering a cycle of falling prices and panic selling. However, analysts expect mutual fund SIP flows are expected to remain stable, and attractive valuations may draw in investors waiting on the sidelines. Stocks linked to dubious entities might take longer to recover, while fundamentally sound ones may rebound more swiftly, they added. Brokerage Nuvama Research in its latest report suggests turning bullish after the recent correction in mid and small-cap stocks. They view the current phase as a correction within an ongoing bull market, reaching oversold conditions at key support levels, recommending long positions. The broader market, previously overheated, has undergone a healthy decline, likely marking the end of the correction phase and the resumption of the bull market. Large caps have also experienced corrective phases without significant damage to the Nifty50. Strong global market tailwinds, upcoming earnings seasons, and general elections indicate favorable risk premiums for long positions in the market, it added.

At close, the Sensex was up 363.20 points or 0.49 percent at 74,014.55, and the Nifty was up 135.10 points or 0.61 percent at 22,462. We wrap up today's edition of the Moneycontrol live market blog, and will be back tomorrow morning with all the latest updates and alerts. Please visithttps://www.moneycontrol.com/markets/global-indicesfor all the global market action. Taking Stock: Sensex, Nifty hit new highs on Day 1 of FY25; realty, metals shine The BSE midcap index rose 1.6 percent and the smallcap gained nearly 3 percent... Read More Markets were in an upbeat mood after a prolonged holiday session last week as both Sensex & Nifty propelled to fresh highs on the back of bargain hunting, which shows that appetite for equity assets continue to remain strong for investors despite hiccups at regular intervals. Although there are challenges related to delayed rate cuts and uncertainty surrounding geo-political tensions, India's strong reform path and expectations that the ruling party could come back to power in the upcoming general elections has been prompting investors to take bullish bets. Following today's record high levels, Nifty faces resistance between 22601-22750 zone while the index has support at 22201-22000 levels. The onset of the new financial year saw a robust start in the markets, with the Sensex surging and closing 363 points higher at 74,014.55, while the Nifty climbed above 22,462. This positive trajectory was fueled by strong global market performance. All sectoral indices saw gains, especially in the metals sector. Additionally, the BSE midcap index witnessed a rise of 1.6%, and the smallcap index boasted an impressive gain of nearly 3%. The prevailing sentiment in the market remains bullish, with evident momentum aiming for the Nifty to reach 22,700. In light of this optimistic outlook, market participants are advised to maintain a strategy of ""buy on dips"". The Nifty opened at gap up and traded with a narrow range thereafter. It registered a new all-time high of 22529.95. The Nifty has been witnessing a sharp upmove since past couple of trading sessions and we expect the momentum to continue. The hourly momentum indicator has triggered a negative crossover which can lead to a consolidation and a dip towards 22400 – 22350 is possible, however it should be used as a buying opportunity as the overall trend appears positive. If Nifty manages to sustain above 22500 then there shall be a further upside till 22670 – 22740. Bank Nifty has broken out of the sideways consolidation on the way up and is witnessing follow through buying interest. It is likely to continue the momentum towards 47850 – 48000 from a short-term perspective. So the minor degree pullbacks should be used as a buying opportunity. The Indian market boarded on a strong trajectory at the onset of the new financial year, with indications pointing towards a continuation of this favourable momentum, in the near term. This confidence is supported by a global rally in expectation of a Fed rate cut in June and a healthy domestic earnings growth forecast in Q4FY24. Notably, metal stocks excelled today, owing to the swift pace of Chinese PMI data, indicating traction in the economic recovery. Going ahead, RBI monetary policy, India PMI data, and US non-farm payroll data will set the direction of the market. The Nifty index encountered a sideways trading session following a robust start, encountering resistance at 22500, coinciding with the highest open interest on the call side. To maintain the upward momentum, the index must decisively breach the 22500 mark, paving the way for further gains towards 22700/22800 levels. On the downside, support is situated at 22350, and as long as the index holds above this level, the overall outlook remains optimistic. The Bank Nifty index displayed upward movement leading up to the crucial RBI policy session this week, surpassing the immediate hurdle at 47500. With lower-end support around the 47000-46800 zone, any retracement towards this level presents a favorable opportunity for long positions. The next obstacle for the BankNifty is at 48000. Post the RBI policy announcement, market direction and sentiment are expected to become clearer. Market started the week with modest gains and hit new life highs, gaining over half a percent. After the gap-up opening, Nifty traded lackluster in the narrow range and finally closed around the opening range at 22462 levels. On the sectoral front, realty and metal performed well while FMCG and Auto traded subdued. The broader indices outperformed the benchmark, wherein smallcap gained over three percent while midcap closed higher by one and a half percent. We are now eyeing 22,700 in Nifty thus participants should maintain a “buy on dips” approach. We feel the participation of the banking pack would continue to play a critical role in maintaining the prevailing momentum, while others may play a supportive role on a rotational basis. Traders should maintain a stock-specific approach and focus on the stocks which are showing higher relative strength. The markets started the new financial year on a robust note and were seen compounding their gains before selected heavyweights dragged the Index marginally lower to settle the session at 22,462 with gains of 135.10 points. Media and Realty were the top performers sector-wise followed by Metal while Auto and FMCG ended the day with minuscule losses. The interest of market participants was more towards the Broader markets as Mid and Smallcaps gained by 1.74% & 3.26% and outshined the Nifty50. On the daily chart, the Index has made a DOJI candlestick pattern at record levels indicating indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. To extend the underlying bull run, the Index must breach the stiff hurdle of 22,500 while the downside is guarded at 22,270.  : Market ended higher for the third consecutive session on April 1 with Nifty around 22,450. At close, the Sensex was up 363.20 points or 0.49 percent at 74,014.55, and the Nifty was up 135.10 points or 0.61 percent at 22,462.00. About 3015 shares advanced, 572 shares declined, and 112 shares unchanged. Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Adani Ports, Shriram Finance and Divis Labs are among the top gainers on the Nifty, while losers are Eicher Motors, Titan Company, Bajaj Auto, LTIMindtree and Nestle.

Analysts, however, remained cautious about margins due to the product mix. The surge in JLR sales has been attributed to heightened production levels and consistent global demand. Retail sales grew 32 percent in the UK, 21 percent in North America and 16 percent internationally from the year-ago period. Sales in China, one of JLR's biggest markets, however, declined 9 percent and a 2 percent in Europe, the country's largest EV player said in a business update. Follow our live blog for all the market action For the March quarter, wholesale volumes reached 110,190 vehicles, a 16 percent growth from the year-ago period. Should you buy, sell or hold? Macquarie has assigned an ""outperform"" call on the stock with a price target of Rs 1,028 a share. The stock has already breached Macquarie's target with an all-time high of Rs 1,065. The brokerage said JLR's performance in Q4 FY24 slightly exceeded expectations in terms of wholesale figures. The EBITDA margin, however, might remain flat quarter-on-quarter when results are released due to a 100 basis points decrease in the share of premium models and higher incentive spending. Morgan Stanley is also bullish on the counter with an ""overweight"" call and a price target of Rs 1,013. Its analysts said that the mix was weaker as they sold fewer of their premium models. They expect JLR's profit margin to be around 9.1 percent during the quarter, better than the previous quarter's 8.8 percent. Nomura also has a ""buy"" call and a target price of Rs 1,057. This implies an upside of over 4 percent from the last close of Rs 1,013. Nomura estimates that JLR will have a free cash flow (FCF) of GBP 600-700 million in the last quarter, which should help them reduce their net debt to less than GBP 1 billion. At 9.20 am, the stock was trading at Rs 1,029 on the National Stock Exchange, up 1.6 percent from the previous close. Tata Motors' stock has rallied over 28 percent in the last three months.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/investors-finding-value-in-high-dividend-yielding-small-caps-12505041.html,"After the recent sell-off in broader markets, several small cap stocks are seen stabilising with few outperforming the markets by a good margin. BSE Smallcap index is up by 4.13 percent since March 13 lows while the benchmark BSE Sensex is trading flat in the similar timeframe. The market sell-off in March has ensured that even high dividend paying small cap stocks have fallen sharply. These dividend paying small-cap stocks are seen stabilising and gaining ground in line with the broader market sentiment. Accumulation is seen in select small cap stocks with high dividend yields according to Darpan Patil, of Rupic Consultancy. He adds that the BSE Smallcap Index is testing the demand zone and a minor reversal in trend can be expected. BSE Smallcap index Gulf Oil Lubricantshares were up by more than five percent,Allcargo Logisticsshares gained by more than two percent whileBanco Productsshares strengthened by more than one percent on March 21 trading session.  All these smallcap stocks are high dividend yielding stocks. Purvesh Shelatkar, head of institutional broking at Monarch Networth Capital, says: “Every deep market correction invites smart opportunistic buyers in a bull market. Such deep cuts should be used to add stocks with positive cash flows and dividend paying companies. Same logic can be applied to high quality smallcap companies.” We find several high dividend paying stocks have corrected up to 13 percent in the past one month. The recent correction has improved the dividend yield and hence can be on radar of long-term investors seeking value in dividends as the intrinsic value increases post correction.  Purvesh points out that the earnings growth for FY25-26 is expected to be better for smallcaps than for large caps and hence the interest in small caps, especially on corrections, will remain high. PE levels for the broader indices haven’t moved much due to earnings growth in the past two years, he adds. Recent strategy report by ICICI Securities highlighted how relatively higher weightage to capex-related sectors and engineering sector of the broader market indices places it better in terms of expected earnings growth when compared to Nifty. Also read:PAT to GDP ratio of smallcaps at 0.7% of GDP has more room for expansion: ICICI Securities Darpan believes in such market situation, where the broader markets are cheaper today than they were at the beginning of the year, investors may find value in dividend paying high quality small cap stocks.

The global A&D space is poised to grow at a healthy pace (5.9% CAGR over CY22- 26), led by technological advancements, rising defence spending, and the emergence of new markets such as space exploration.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/insurance-stocks-gain-on-irdais-surrender-value-rollback-brokerages-turn-positive-12522761.html,"HDFC Life, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Max Financial Services and SBI Life gained up to 5 percent on March 26 intra-day deals after the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) left surrender values for non-linked and linked policies unchanged. Brokerages see the status quo as a huge relief for life insurers and expects them to maintain profitability, without any major pressure on margins. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities reiterated a ""buy"" call on all listed life players, betting on their inexpensive valuations as the big uncertainty over surrender penalty is behind. ""The current market prices imply long-term premium growth of 3-7 percent for private life insurers.  Max Life is best placed at the current juncture, SBI Life remains a steady ship,"" they said. Life insurers had raised concerns about IRDAI's December 2023 proposal, which suggested introduction of threshold premiums and higher surrender values for endowment policies. Surrender value is the amount paid by the insurance company to the policyholder upon terminating the policy before the maturity date. ALSO READ:IRDAI’s status quo on surrender charges a relief for insurers, but setback for policyholders The move would have led to around 75 percent decline in surrender profits of non-par products and 140-200 basis points (bps) impact on private life insurers' margins, analysts at Kotak said. Under the final IRDAI guidelines, which will take effect from April 1, the surrender values for life insurance policies are expected to largely remain the same or even lower if policies are surrendered within a period of three years. For life insurance policies surrendered between fourth to seventh year, surrender value may see a minor increase. Analysts at Emkay Global, too, expect listed life insurers to grow in teens and maintain their margins in the mid-20s. Without this development, life insurers would have struggled to handle higher surrender charges for customers who let their policies lapse, they said. They would also have to face the challenge of providing benefits to policyholders who keep their policies active, keeping profitability in mind. ""We maintain our positive view on listed life insurers, backed by their franchise strength and favourable valuation. We prefer ICICI Prudential, Max Financial, and SBI Life from the pack,"" Emkay Global analysts said. On other hand, global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley expects HDFC Life to perform better in the near-term. ""The final surrender value norms seem manageable given they are largely unchanged versus existing norms,"" they said.

Taking Stock: Sensex, Nifty reverse losses to close higher ahead of Fed outcome Top Nifty gainers were Eicher Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Power Grid Corporation, Nestle India and ONGC, while losers were Tata Steel, Tata Consumer Products, Tata Motors, Axis Bank and Cipla... Read More Markets traded volatile and ended almost unchanged, taking a breather after Tuesday’s decline. After the initial uptick, it resumed decline in no time however recovery in select heavyweights pared losses as the session progressed. On the sectoral front, a mixed trend continued wherein energy, FMCG and realty edged higher while metal and financials ended in the red. We may see a breather after the recent fall but the tone is likely to remain negative. Participants should continue with the “sell on rise” approach until Nifty decisively reclaims 22,100 level. Also, we reiterate our preference for index majors over others and avoid adding to the loss making positions. The index remained volatile ahead of the Fed's policy meeting. The overall sentiment remains negative as the index closed below the previous consolidation low. Additionally, the index ended the session below the critical moving average. However, a further fall is anticipated below the recent swing low on the hourly chart, which is positioned around 21700. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 21900-22000. Markets displayed range-bound trend and ended marginally higher as caution prevailed ahead of the US Fed meet outcome on interest rate. While there will be little chance of rate tinkering, the Fed's commentary on inflation and its take on interest rate will be keenly watched. Rising oil prices and currency losing momentum in the last few days could fuel more volatility in the near term. The Nifty witnessed an extremely volatile day of trade today. It opened with gains however was unable to sustain and sold off. Intraday it witnessed a sharp pullback from 21710 levels and closed the day marginally in the green up ~22 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty has taken support around the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the previous rise from 21530 – 22526. The momentum set up on the hourly time frame suggests exhaustion of selling pressure as there are signs of a positive divergence and is currently having a positive crossover. In terms of price pattern, the daily candle has taken form of a Doji pattern which suggests indecision among market participants regarding the direction as both bulls and bears are trying hard to defend their respective boundaries. This could lead to consolidation and the range could be 21700 – 22000. Bank Nifty closed the day on a negative note for the Ninth consecutive trading session. The fall has found support at the lower end of the rising channel and daily lower Bollinger band placed at 45800. The hourly momentum indicator has a positive crossover which is a buy signal. Thus, we can expect a recovery to 46800 – 46950 over the next few trading sessions. On March 20, Indian benchmark indices closed with marginal gains amidst a volatile session. At the close, the Sensex was up 89.64 points or 0.12 percent at 72,101.69, while the Nifty gained 21.60 points or 0.10 percent, closing at 21,839.10. The Sensex and Nifty ended higher amid volatility ahead of the Fed meeting outcomes. After a flat positive start, the Nifty experienced a dip near the 21,700 level, reaching a low of 21,710.65, then bounced back above 21,900, peaking at 21,930 before closing at 21,855.10. The daily chart showed the formation of a doji candlestick, indicating continued bearish pressure in the market. Technical analysis suggests that the Nifty has broken down daily trend line, hinting at a potential reversal of the uptrend. Furthermore, it has dipped below the critical short-term moving average, signaling weakening momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also displayed a bearish crossover, indicating mounting selling pressure. Key levels to monitor include resistance at 22,000 and support at 21,700. A breach below 21,700 could trigger further correction towards the 21,600 levels. Examination of the Open Interest (OI) data reveals the highest OI on the call side at the 22,000 strike price, followed by the 22,300 strike price. On the put side, the highest OI was observed at the 21,500 strike price. The Bank Nifty encountered another round of volatility, with the ongoing struggle between bulls and bears persisting, particularly ahead of the US Fed meeting. Key support lies within the 46000-45800 zone, and maintaining these levels on a closing basis suggests a continued bullish stance. Immediate resistance is positioned at 47000, coinciding with the 20DMA, and a decisive close above this level could reignite the upward trend, targeting levels around 48000-48500. Lifted by favourable global sentiment and solid direct tax collection, Indian markets rebounded, closing with modest gains. Robust FII & DII inflows sustained the market. As per latest market consensus, the odds of rate cut in June have reduced. The US Fed is likely to delay the cut rate to the latter part of the year due to a resilient economy. Domestic mid & small caps are likely to lag large caps driven by premium valuations, in the short-term.

After a weak start, the market recovered but remained in negative territory for most of the session. Final hour buying trimmed most of the losses. Top Nifty losers were Hero MotoCorp, HCL Technologies, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI Life Insurance, while gainers included Tata Consumers Products, M&M, BPCL, Bajaj Auto and Adani Ports.

Strong outperformance continued by the Broader markets as both Mid and Smallcaps ended the session higher with gains of more than 1%. The Index has made another DOJI candlestick pattern on the daily chart and a strong move above 22,500 will open the gate for 22,640 while on the downside 22,340 will act as a support. Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas The Nifty opened on a flat note and consolidated for the day. It closed marginally in the red down ~9 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty is in the process of cooling off after the sharp run-up in the previous couple of trading sessions. The zone of 22400 – 22350 is the crucial support zone and dips towards these zones should be used as a buying opportunity. The hourly momentum indicator has a negative crossover which is a sell signal and also suggests that there could be some more consolidation before the uptrend resumes. Overall, this dip should be used a buying opportunity. Bank Nifty is also consolidating after breaking out of the range on the upside. It is likely to resume its up-move towards 47850 – 48000 from a short-term perspective. So the minor degree pullbacks should be used as a buying opportunity.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/can-real-estate-continue-to-scale-new-highs-12602041.html,"On April 2, HDFC Asset Management Company,announced that it would be discontinuing fresh subscriptions and capped systematic investment plan (SIP) flows into its realty index fund. The HDFC Nifty Realty Index Fund, which opened its new fund offering or NFO on March 7 and closed on March 21, is the first ever mutual fund scheme to focus on the realty sector.  While the company has not stated a reason for this, Moneycontrol had reported that, according to market experts, the high valuations and rally in real estate stocks could be the underlying cause.Moneycontrol has reached out to HDFC AMCto get their perspective and will update the copy once they respond. Also read:HDFC Nifty Realty Index Fund stops lumpsum investments, restricts SIPs days after launch Will overvaluation dampen enthusiasm for the sector? Over the last couple of quarters, realty stocks and the seen smart growth. The Nifty Realty Index touched 959.10  points on April 2, led by a bullish outlook for the segment. The last time the index neared this level was in May 2008. Individual stocks have also seen rapid gains on the back of fresh buying of land parcels and new joint ventures being formed. The sector also got a boost when it was the Reserve Bank of India at its recent monetary policy committee meeting decided to keep interest rates unchanged. All this has translated into a good run for realty stocks. Godrej Properties has gained over 116.8 percent (price/earnings multiple of 111.79) over the last one year; while Brigade Enterprises has gained around 96 percent (PE of 70.62). But this in turn has raised questions about valuation, with the PE expanding rapidly over the last one year. Currently, the Nifty Realty PE ratio is around 62.3 times against 38.2 times in April 2023. Returns over the last one year have been around 125 percent. In a January 20 report, CLSA analysts had expressed concerns that a lot of the growth potential had already been factored into valuations. While they were positive that the segment would see growth, the report added that property stocks had gone up sharply over the past three months, and as per their reverse DCF or discounted cash flow valuation, very high growth was already built into current prices, which they believe will be difficult to achieve considering the cyclicality of the sector.  However, not all see this as a problem. According to Karan Khanna, lead analyst, small- and mid-caps, hotels and property, Ambit Capital, only a handful of sectors, including real estate, will experience significant growth of 15-20 percent over the next few years. ""Unlike past cycles, where developers primarily used their operating cash flows for land acquisition and project funding, the current cycle shows developers maintaining control over leverage and adjusting pricing according to demand trends. This suggests that future earnings potential for real estate developers looks promising and robust, which is likely to be reflected in their valuations,” he said. A similar view was expressed by analysts at Nuvama in their March 2024 report. According to the brokerage, even as many real estate stocks are now trading at a premium to their net asset value, valuations are in line with the previous upcycle. ""We argue that value exists on a relative basis given the strong cash flows, all-time low leverage, industry consolidation, and market share gains, and expect buoyancy in housing sales to sustain and stay positive on property stocks from a medium-term perspective,"" the report said. ""Additionally, a potential interest rate cut in CY24E can be a stock catalyst, in our view,"" it added. Also read:Boom in luxury keeps real estate stocks on top. Can the rally sustain? Rupesh Sankhe, senior analyst, utilities, renewables, capital goods and real estate at Elara Capital, said that while commercial real estate may be softer, the residential segment is flourishing, so investors shouldn't worry about high valuations. ""Given the stronger balance sheets and the fact that we're only in the third year of a real estate cycle that typically spans 6–10 years, current valuations appear justified. Furthermore, indicators show that the market is swiftly absorbing new launches, adding to our confidence in its resilience,"" he said. From recovery to outperformance The sector, experts say, had not been doing well for over a decade before showing signs of recovery in 2020, owing to the cyclical nature of the sector. Saurabh Rathi, managing director and co-head, Motilal Oswal Real Estate, said that recent trends show high demand and limited supply, leading to the lowest inventory overhang in years. In CY23., sales were about 5.3 lakh units, the highest in the last 10–12 years. Supply for the same period was only 4.5 lakh units. ""If you would look at data across 2012 to 2021, generally, the supply would have outstripped demand by a significant margin. But because for the last two and a half years demand has been beating supply, today we are standing at an inventory overhang of about 11 months only,"" he explained. "" In my 16–18 year career in real estate, this is the lowest that I've ever seen at a country level. At times, some cities have done well, and they have had a lower inventory overhang. But at an India-level or country-level, 11 months is unheard of. So this is very positive."" For the first time, he added, demand and supply are also backed by a steady increase in price. ""Historically, if you look back at 2012, which was probably a very overheated environment, prices weren't stable. This time around, over the last two years, on average over two years, we have seen a price rise of 15 percent (about 7-8 percent annualised)., which is very, very balanced when such kind of demand comes in. That's a very reasonable price increase,"" he said. This demand is expected to hold for quite some time because while cities like Mumbai and Pune have already seen peak demand and absorption, other markets like Bengaluru, Chennai and the Delhi-NCR area are yet to go back to their peak cycles, providing more scope for growth. Opportunities Most analysts are placing their bets on large real estate developers. Sankhe is positive because these developers are well-prepared with strong projects and solid balance sheets, boasting an equity ratio of just 0.3 times. This, he said, leaves them plenty of room to expand, and they are doing so by actively signing memoranda of understanding, acquiring land and partnering with smaller developers. ""Despite recent stock price increases, today's valuations are underpinned by stronger fundamentals compared to previous real estate booms. Additionally, pent-up demand from the 2014-2020 slowdown is driving growth in the residential sector,"" Sankhe pointed out. Among the large developers on analysts' lists areDLF, Sobha,Lodha, Brigade,Phoenix Millsand Sunteck. While brokerages like Nuvama have a buy call on Godrej Properties, analysts at Ambit have a sell call on the stock due to its ""unfavourable"" valuations. Risks For most analysts tracking the sector, the challenges are currently minimal. While there may be some slowdown in buying and construction during the upcoming election season, demand could pick up as soon as customers have clarity on the results, job creation and earning capacity. According to Khanna, in the long run, execution could be the sole stumbling block. ""The only challenge is continuing with the execution track record over the next two or three years because skilled labor availability will be a challenge, that's one. Second, there could be a slowdown during the election period,"" he added.

At 9.50 am,Eicher Motorsstock was at Rs 3,863, up 4 percent from the previous close. UBS analysts have raised their price target on Eicher Motors stock to Rs 5,000, implying an upside of 34.5 percent from the last close. Despite being aggressively priced, the launches by Harley Davidson and Bajaj Auto's triumph failed to increase volume significantly. As of February 2024, Harley and Triumph's cumulative volume of the models launched stood at around 4,000 units, well below the expected guidance. Follow our live blog for all the market action UBS believes that even as competitors have entered the market aiming to challenge Eichers' dominance, none of them have been able to make a significant impact on customers. Rivals have also attempted to outdo Royal Enfield with better specifications and aggressive pricing but haven't been able to match Royal Enfield's qualitative and emotive edge. ""These aspects are challenging for competitors to replicate."" As per SIAM data, the company's market share in the premium motorcycle segment has risen despite competition. Figures show that its market share in Q2FY23 stood at 42 percent and increased to 45 percent in Q3FY24. Not just that, the company is also planning to launch a new bike -- Roadster. Analysts believe that the launch will bridge the performance gap previously seen when compared to the likes of Harley Davidson and Triumph. This new model offers industry-leading performance, especially featuring Royal Enfield's first liquid-cooled engine, anticipated to address concerns regarding engine heating in hot conditions and heavy traffic. ""We believe the upcoming 450cc roadster, potentially followed by additional body forms, will stimulate replacement demand among Royal Enfield's 350cc customers."", UBS said in a note. On exports, the brokerage anticipates a strong rebound in exports for FY25-FY26, led by the ramp-up of the Himalayan 450, the introduction of additional 650cc models, and a recovery in demand across specific end-markets. UBS projections indicate a 25 percent growth in export demand during FY25-26, contrasting with the 23 percent decline observed in FY24. ""We expect Eicher Motors to outperform the industry on volume growth over the medium term. It continues to have a strong launch pipeline, while most key competitors have already launched products,"" UBS said.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/power-stocks-momentum-takes-a-hit-but-fundamental-outlook-on-sector-positive-12521491.html,"The recent market correction has taken a toll on energy and power utility stocks as well but there is no cause for alarm yet, say people who track the sector. In a recent report, analysts at Jefferies said opportunities for the power segment could come in through increased capex and higher merchant prices for power following the onset of summer. Over the last three months, the BSE utilities index has gained around 8 percent. Also read:Is this the right time to invest in green hydrogen stocks? Most energy and power utility stocks have been on a tear through 2023, earning them an additional moniker of ""momentum stocks"". The pace of gains moderated towards the end of the year, leading a section of the market to think that valuations may have peaked for the time. Do fund managers overseeing dedicated power sector funds continue to have faith in the growing opportunity within the space and see investment potential? Paras Matalia, Fund Manager, SAMCO Active Momentum Fund, says his fund has reduced exposure to stocks across the sectors as they have been struggling since January this year. “If at all the markets go up again from here, then eventually our equity exposure will also go up based on the momentum,” he says. The fund has power and energy stocks such as PFC, REC, Inox Wind, Adani Power, ONGC, and Power Grid. Launched in July 2023, it has gained around 23 percent to date. Here is what other thematic fund managers have to say: Vikas Gupta,  smallcase manager and CEO, Omniscience Capital Investment Case:Gupta says he was one of the early players in the power space, adding the stock to his portfolios during 2018–2020. The sector has been negative for the last 10 years because there was oversupply and less demand, among other reasons, he says. As many projects could not be completed, it also resulted in a lot of NPAs for power finance companies; hence, people lost interest in the segment. The bet for Gupta has played out well. “We waited patiently for over 1–1.5 years before the value-unlocking began in 2022-2024. Some stocks are rerating four or five times. But even despite that they are valued at 7x or 8x PE, making valuations reasonable,” Gupta says. While selecting stocks, they make conclusions without looking at price action. “I need more value than the price. For example, I need a Rs 100 value, and I need a Rs 50 price. That's the only reason we look at the price. I don't care whether it's going up or down. as long as it is significantly below the intrinsic value,” he says. Gupta continues to see opportunities for growth across all aspects of traditional power — from power finance to transmission and distribution. Many power companies, from NTPC to SJVN and NLC, are doing huge capex. “Most of these companies are getting plans commissioned in the next two years, which will nearly double their revenues in the near future,"" he says but cautions that often ROE in the space may look low because a lot of work that is happening is reported in the capital as work in progress. “But actually, if it's work in progress, I should remove that and adjust to what the return on operating equity is, and that will be quite good, and the same thing will be replicated when these new projects come,” he adds. While most fund managers are excited about the renewable space, there is some scepticism about its valuation. Stocks within the segment are currently priced in the growth opportunity and are often overvalued due to the market buzz about the area, Gupta says. Instead, they prefer to look at traditional players likeNTPCorNHPC, which also have a renewable component, he says. Like Gupta, most fund managersMoneycontrolspoke to said they are open to investing in the space as and when the valuation is right and “the market presents the right opportunity.”. Also read:Abakkus takes a bite of LT Foods. What is the investment case? Power and energy presence in funds Power is a part of many of their diversified small-case portfolios as well as their omni power portfolio, which, according to their websites, has been growing at a 3-year CAGR of 51.73 percent since its launch in 2021. Barring renewables, which are slightly overvalued, Gupta he is bullish across all power stocks — from NTPC to NLC and REC. Rohit Singhania, Co-head - Equity, DSP Mutual Fund Investment case Singhania says that as a house, they have been positive on the power segment due to the strong demand growth in the segment over the last three years. As India moves towards its goal of becoming a manufacturing hub, apart from a demand for labour and land reforms, there will also be a demand for 24x7 power. “If you look at power costs during peak hours, they go up almost twice. This shows the pressure on demand. That means you need more power plants. Till two years ago, the belief was that there was a need for more renewables. But now that everyone has understood, even Europe is talking about thermal power plants and gas-based power plants. So, the entire value chain of people who are setting up, the companies who are going to fund them, are going to benefit from it,” he says. But the key, is the price at which you are getting those businesses. “The scope of activity is quite a lot. You will have that continuing for the next three to four years, if not more, and most of the companies in the value chain are already more or less pricing in most of the growth, barring a few. So that's the worry: You like the business, you like the opportunity, but you're paying everything for the business today itself,” he says. At DSP, they just own very few names where they are comfortable with the business outlook and also with the price. “For me, as a fund manager, it has to be a combination of both — as an investor if you're investing just in the power sector and saying I want to put money in, you have to take a slightly longer call, maybe three or four years because you're not going to get that front-end return,” he says. Power and energy presence in funds DSP’s TIGER. Fund has stocks like NTPC and NHPC, while the New Energy Fund is focused more on the oil and gas parts of the energy supply chain. Over the last five years, the TIGER fund has given 175.6 percent returns and around 55.7 percent in returns over one year. The New Energy Fund has given returns of 145 percent and 41.3 percent for the same periods. In terms of energy stocks, it has oil and gas stocks like Gail, Petronet and Oil India. Sanjay Doshi, Fund Manager -Equity Investments, Nippon Mutual Fund Doshi manages Nippon’s Power and Infrastructure Fund. Investment case:Current valuations are reasonable even for larger companies, he says. “We have to look at it from the capabilities of these companies to make the most of it and how they are moving in it. In that sense, none of these companies have moved above their peak valuations in the last cycle. So given that you have a more regulated structure on returns, which is likely to stay for another five years at least because that's what the new norms have already been out in the public domain, so in that sense, you can definitely trade at 1.8 to 2.5 times your books and all, and then if you add the kicker of renewables and all, the valuations are not expensive, and some of them can definitely see very steady growth and therefore more comfort in valuation over a longer period of time,” Doshi says. Over the past year, the fund has given returns of 31 percent and over 5 percent over 132 percent. Doshi says that they definitely see good growth opportunities and a large capex coming into the power space in the next five to seven years due to power demand. If India has to grow at 7-8 percent plus GDP, then it will definitely require at least 1.2 times the growth in power itself. “Structurally, I think very clearly, we need to have a better mix of renewables within the overall power mix, which today is less than 35 percent, and that needs to go up beyond 50 percent,"" he says. India also needs to ensure we have enough power and energy security; hence, in the near term, we will see higher demand for coal-based power,"" he says. Power and energy presence in funds While the fund is mostly infrastructure-focused, around 18 percent of its allocation is to the power segment through stocks like NTPC,Power Grid,Tata Power, andCESC. Over the past year, the fund has given returns of 70.34 percent and around 204.6 percent over the last five years.

The index has rallied nearly 4.5 percent from its previous swing low of 21,710 made on March 20. The volatility index, considered the fear gauge of the market, plunged to its lowest level of 11.36, providing comfort to bulls. A buy-on-dips strategy could be adopted if the Nifty holds above the 22,450 level. However, if the index slips below these levels the bullish momentum could fade out and potentially lead towards the levels around 22,200.

The Bank Nifty continued its bullish rally, with a modest uptick of 0.31 percent, settling at 48,730.55. In the larger time frame the private and PSU banking stocks show strength, offering support on a rotational basis. While Bank Nifty is trending higher, the continuous formation of Doji candles on the daily chart raises short-term concerns. However, the index remains above the middle Bollinger Band, with a potential buying opportunity around the 48,400 level. Weekly support is expected at 47,800 with resistance at 49,200.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/yen-at-34-yr-low-after-boj-ends-negative-interest-rate-these-3-indian-stocks-may-benefit-12539781.html,"The Japanese yen hit a 34-year low recently after the Bank of Japan moved to end negative interest rates. Usually, rate hikes strengthen the currency as higher interest rates draw investors putting money in debt. However, in the case of the yen, the message from the central bank officials has been more dovish. The market has taken this as a signal that monetary policy will continue to be accommodative, and this is weighing on the yen. ""The statement suggested that this is not the start of an aggressive rate hiking cycle, even though wage inflation is set to pick up strongly,” said Kunal Sodhani, Shinhan Bank. Also read:Yen on intervention watch; Asia shares subdued “Investors have been selling the yen for the dollar because the interest rate difference is wide; BoJ is following an ultraloose monetary policy and the US Fed, a tight (monetary) policy,” he said. This is the third time in two years that the Yen has fallen as low as 152 to the dollar. On the previous two occasions, there was a strong and sustained reversal. So the market is expecting some intervention by the BoJ around these levels, Sodhani said, adding ""As per charts, USD-JPY is open to 154.00 levels, while a close below 149.20 can bring the pair back into a consolidation phase"". Auto-ancillary companies supplying components to Japanese automakers and Indian banks with yen exposure could benefit from exchange rate gains resulting from a weaker Yen. Additionally, Indian businesses reliant on importing goods and services from Japan might find relief as a softer yen could lower their import costs. This favourable condition could extend across various sectors, including electronics, machinery, automotive, chemicals, and FMCG, Aamir Makda, Commodity & Currency Analyst, Choice Broking told Moneycontrol. Also read:Yen hits 34-year low ahead of key US inflation test The weakening of the Yen, especially to a 34-year low, can have significant impacts on various sectors in India, particularly the automotive industry, according to CA Krishnan R, Director & CEO of Unimoni Financial Services. 90 ""Many Indian companies are collaborating with Japanese companies for technology exchange and components. A weaker yen will make Japanese products relatively cheaper in international markets, and this will be beneficial for the Indian automotive industry, especially Maruti Suzuki,"" he said. Maruti Suzukigave 3.6 percent of the net total income as royalty to its parent entity Suzuki Motor Corporation (Japan) in FY21. Additionally, the value of imports in yen also accounts for 7-8 percent of the company's annual income. Following the slump in yen, Maruti Suzuki shares rose 3 percent on March 27 to hit a fresh record high of Rs 12,722 on NSE. Lumax IndustriesandJTEKT Indiaare poised for favourable outcomes. Lumax Industries' collaboration with Japan-based Stanley Electric Company entails royalty payments in yen, while JTEKT India's transactions with its Japanese parent JTEKT Corporation are denominated in yen. This reduction in costs enhances operational efficiency and also augments financial performance, thereby positively influencing stock values in the automobile and related sectors. Therefore, the yen depreciation directly translates into improved prospects for these stocks affiliating with Japan.

After the merger, the bank is expected to expand into new geographical areas and product segments, with robust growth in high-yielding Wheels, MFI, Gold and SBL segments. Moreover, since Fincare is a rural-focused SFB with 85% of its advances qualifying under the priority sector, the merger will enable AUBANK to not only meet its PSL target but also generate PSLC income in the long run.

We revised our target price to Rs. 246 and upgrade our rating to BUY factoring in expected improvements in utilization and margin, along with the correction in valuation. Q3FY24 revenue grew by 16%YoY, aided by volume improvement (14%YoY) from new capacities. However, SCL has lowered volume guidance for FY24 due to the impact of the flood and state elections. Ramp up in new capacities along with lower input prices aided operating profit to increase by 83% YoY to Rs.87cr. Net loss narrowed to Rs.10cr vs. Rs.27cr YoY. Margin will improve further with better utilization. Recent pressure on cement prices is the key risk to watch out for.

After the initial uptick, Nifty slipped sharply lower in the early hours however strength in heavyweights, especially from banking and IT majors, helped the index to recoup losses and inch higher. Eventually, Nifty settled at 22,514.65 level; up by 0.4%. Meanwhile, a mixed trend continued on the sectoral front wherein FMCG and energy closed in the red. The buoyancy continued on the broader front wherein smallcap gained nearly half a percent. We expect the prevailing tone to continue however the pace of advance would largely depend upon the performance of banking and IT majors. Participants should continue with the “buy on dips” approach and focus more on stock selection. Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares Extreme volatility was seen in today's trade as the Index started the session at the record level of 22,600 but higher levels did not last for long and a steep fall was seen across the board. Selected IT and Banking counters guided the Index for recovery to end the session higher at 22,514.65 with gains of 80 points. Disparity was seen in the Broader markets where Midcaps marginally underperformed while Smallcaps performed in line with the Frontline Index. The Index has made a Hanging Man candlestick pattern at the record levels which is generally considered a reversal pattern but a firm close above 22,600 will negate the implications of the bearish candle while a level of 22,300 will continue to act as a strong base.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pnb-housing-finance-zooms-8-as-morgan-stanley-stays-bullish-sets-target-at-rs-970-12552941.html,"Shares of PNB Housing Finance zoomed over 8 percent on April 1 after Morgan Stanley put an 'overweight' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 970 per share. The international brokerage's call comes after CARE Ratings and ICRA upgraded the company's long-term rating to 'AA+' citing improvements in the company's asset quality. The upgrade is also supported by the housing finance company's strengthened capital position and diversified resource profile. The fourth quarter typically sees strong performance for housing finance companies due to loan growth and improved asset quality, noted Morgan Stanley. With valuation standing at 1x FY25 P/B and 9x P/E, PNB Housing appears attractive to investors, the brokerage said. CARE Ratings upgradedPNB Housingto 'AA+' from 'AA' with a ‘stable’ outlook from ‘positive’ due to its improving asset quality and strong market position. The ratings upgrade is applicable to a range of facilities and debt instruments, including its long-term and short-term bank facilities, bonds, non-convertible bonds, tier-2 bonds, and fixed deposits. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action The ratings agency said the upgrade reflected the improved asset quality of the housing finance company, with its gross NPA ratio at 1.73 percent at the end of December 2023, compared to 8 percent in March last year. The stable outlook was on the expectation that the housing financier would show profitable business growth along with healthy resource-raising ability and strong internal accruals. ICRA has upgraded the company's debt instrument rating to 'ICRA AA+ (Stable)' from 'ICRA AA (Positive)'. The rating upgrade factors in the sustained improvement in PNB Housing Finance's credit profile, driven by the improved asset quality metrics and the strengthened capitalisation profile. Given the intense competition in the mortgage finance business, the company's ability to maintain its net interest margin while improving its operating efficiency and controlling the credit costs will be important from a credit perspective, it said.

The index ended the session below the critical moving average and a further fall is anticipated below the recent swing low on the hourly chart, which is positioned around 21,700. On the higher end, resistance is at 21,900-22,000. Jatin Gedia, technical research analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas On the daily chart, the Nifty has taken support around the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the previous rise from 21,530 – 22,526. The momentum setup on the hourly time frame suggests exhaustion of selling pressure as there are signs of a positive divergence. It currently has a positive crossover. In terms of price pattern, the daily candle has taken the form of a Doji pattern, which suggests indecision among market participants regarding the direction as both bulls and bears are trying hard to defend their boundaries. This could lead to consolidation and the range could be 21,700– 22,000. Bank Nifty closed the day on a negative note for the ninth consecutive trading session, its worst losing streak in almost 23 years.. The fall found support at the lower end of the rising channel and daily lower Bollinger band placed at 45,800. The hourly momentum indicator has a positive crossover, which is a buy signal.
