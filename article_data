Here are the 5 factors driving the rally today: Financials rise Financials rose after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) eased recently tightened rules for lender investments in alternative investment funds (AIFs). Instead of a 100 percent provision, banks now only need to set aside funds for the portion of their investment in an AIF that is further invested in debtor companies.

Investors expect inflation to shrink leading to the Fed cutting rates from June onwards. Steven Blitz, TS Lombard’s chief U.S. economist believes, markets will continue to rally even if the Federal Reserve chooses not to cut interest rates this year. Strong FII inflows Foreign portfolio investors bought Indian equities worth Rs 2,170 crore on a net basis in the previous session, while domestic institutional investors purchased a net Rs 1,198 core worth of stocks. After remaining net sellers in the past two months, FIIs have turned buyers in March and have bought shares worth Rs 3,000 crore, so far, this month. The rise in FPI inflows comes on the back of improving macros, declining inflation, hopes of rate cuts from June and the possibility of the Modi government returning for a third term. The record-high performance of domestic equities and robust financial activity also aided the positive sentiment.

A bounce was due from there, Jay Vora, market analyst at Indiacharts.com, said. ""Now, 22,526 is a major resistance level for the Nifty on the upside. Below this level, a correction could still be in place. However, if the index manages to breach this level, the positive momentum could continue in the near term,"" he said. If the 22,526 is surpassed on the upside, largecaps could outperform because they will be relatively stronger.

"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report onAster DM Healthcare Our ASTER DM Healthcare (ASTERDM) India EBITDA stands increased by 4- 5% for FY25 and FY26 as we factor in higher operating margins. This has been aided by gross margin expansion, occupancy scale up and faster ramp up in its Whitefield new unit. ASTERDM India’s EBITDA increased sharply over last 3 years (30% CAGR over FY20-23) and growth momentum continued in FY24 with ~30% YoY growth. We estimate 29% pre IND AS EBITDA CAGR from India business over FY24-26E aided by scale up in margins, healthy ARPOB and bed additions. At current market price, adjusted for GCC and minority stake, the India business is trading at 17x EV/EBITDA on FY26E respectively which is at 15- 40% discount to listed peers. We believe such steep discount is unwarranted given similar growth profile. Outlook We maintain ‘BUY’ rating with revised TP of Rs515 (earlier Rs. 500) valuing India hospital segment at 22x EV/EBITDA on FY26E EBITDA.

"The market is expected to consolidate further as long as the Nifty 50 holds below 22,500, which is a crucial level to watch out for going ahead as surpassing this on a closing basis can open the doors for the 22,700-22,800 levels in the short term, with immediate support at 22,300-22,200, followed by crucial support at 22,000, experts said. On April 2, the market has saw consolidation and closed moderately lower because of recovery in the last hour of trade. The Nifty 50 fell 9 points to 22,453 and formed a Doji kind of candlestick pattern on the daily charts, while the BSE Sensex declined 111 points to 73,904. The broader markets continued to outperform the benchmark indices as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 1.2 percent each, while the declining volatility remained quite supportive for bulls, as the India VIX declined 3.55 percent to 11.65 level, the lowest closing level in current calendar year. Stocks that recorded healthy gains on the day of consolidation included Steel Authority of India, Bharat Electronics, and IRCTC.Steel Authority of Indiahas seen a decisive breakout of downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of February 7 and March 4, and clocked 5 percent rally at Rs 148 on the NSE. The stock has formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, with healthy volumes, while the stock traded above all key moving averages. Bharat Electronicsdecisively surpassed its previous record high and rallied 4.7 percent to end at record closing high of Rs 221. The stock has formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe with robust volumes, while the stock traded above all key moving averages. IRCTChas seen a breakout of horizontal resistance trendline adjoining multiple touchpoints and climbed 3.5 percent to Rs 1,003.8. The stock has formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with above average volumes, while trading above all key moving averages. Here's what Riyank Arora of Mehta Equities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: SAIL The stock has touched an important resistance zone of Rs 148.40 - 150.00 on its daily timeframe charts. With the RSI (relative strength index - 14) on the daily timeframe being 68.74, the momentum indicates a strong uptrend in the stock. An immediate support is placed at Rs 143 mark, below which the stock would lose its strength. On the upside, a breakout above Rs 151 should trigger an up-move in the stock towards Rs 157.50 and Rs 160 gradually over time. We advise traders to keep a trailing stop-loss at Rs 143 mark for all open positions in the stock.  Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation(IRCTC) The stock has given a good breakout above its recent swing high resistance mark of Rs 989.90 and successfully managed to close above the same. Anchor VWAP (volume-weighted average price) suggests a major support placed near Rs 940 mark, a closing below which should trigger a downside move in the stock. On the upside, however, targets are maintained near Rs 1,050 and above. We advise short-term investors to keep a strict stop-loss at Rs 940 mark on a daily closing basis in the stock. Bharat Electronics The stock has given a good breakout above its all-time high resistance mark of Rs 216.80 on the daily charts. With the RSI (14) on daily charts being near 69.70 and the stock witnessing a sharp surge in volumes, with the volume being nearly 3 times its average (30) days traded volumes - the stock looks poised for an upside move towards Rs 240 and Rs 250 in a spree of momentum rally. Any pullback towards Rs 217-218 should offer a good buy on the stock. We advise traders to keep a strict stop-loss at Rs 212 mark on a daily closing basis. 
"," The Nifty 50 is expected to consolidate further and close below 22,500, potentially opening the door for the 22,700-22,800 levels in the short term. Support at 22,300-22,200, followed by crucial support at 22,000, could provide strong levels of resistance. Stocks like Steel Authority of India, Bharat Electronics, and IRCTC have seen healthy gains on the day of consolidation. Investors should keep trailing stop-loss orders at Rs 143 and Rs 940 for IRCTC and Bharat Electronics respectively. Investors should also consider a strict stop-loss at Rs 212 and Rs 217 for Bharat Electronics and Steel Authority of India respectively."

"Motilal Oswal's research report onMCX MCX will be looking to grow volumes driven by new products, such as Steel Bar (launched), Gold Serial contracts, and Power contracts. Once the future volumes on these products exceed the threshold of INR8-10b (one-year average ADTO) options, contracts will also be launched. Retail participation in the Indian commodities market (1.4m UCCs) is low when compared to equity market participation (40m NSE active clients). Strong technology-based offerings from discount brokers, along with lower ticket-size contracts from MCX, can improve the participation significantly. FPIs, last year, received approval from the regulator to invest in cash-settled commodities. In a follow-up to the same, MCX has launched its direct market access (DMA) facility for Category-I FPIs. Once the same is available to Category –II FPIs, we believe, the volume momentum will pick up notably. Regulatory measures, such as interoperability of margins between stock exchanges and commodity exchanges, allowing partial withdrawal of SGF or determining clients' margin requirements on net positions, if implemented, have the potential to further boost volumes. Outlook We expect MCX to deliver an FY24-26 revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 28%/ 205%/157%, fueled by a 47% CAGR in options volumes.

"When it comes to the least-loved sectors by investors, two wheeler figures pretty much high up on that list. So it would come as a surprise to most people that the top two consistent performers in the Nifty over the last one year have been Bajaj Auto and Hero Motocorp. Similarly, few would have been willing to bet their money onAdani Portsafter the pounding it look in January and February last year over the Hindenburg report. Here too the street is in for a surprise: Adani Ports figures at number three for consistency. Follow our market blog for live updates To test the consistency of performance of Nifty 50 stocks in FY24 we observed the monthly returns of Nifty 50 constituents and compared it with Nifty 50 returns.

However there are at least 16 Nifty stocks that gave positive returns on more occasions, reflecting better consistency in performance in FY24. And Adani Ports, Hero MotoCorp, andBajaj Autohave given the maximum positive returns among the 16 contesters. Better consistency also indicates momentum in the underlying security.

On the back of the resilient Indian economy, Hero MotoCorp’s  management expects to grow in double digits with new premium product launches, ramp-up of the EV product portfolio, introducing new Premia stores, Vida Hubs and upgrading existing stores to Hero 2.0, said Axis Securities in a report. The brokerage firm further said that reduced inventory levels and higher enquiries from rural geographies with higher demand for 125+ cc vehicles gives management the confidence to beat average industry growth in FY25.

"The Indian pharmaceutical market (IPM) reported a 9.5 percent increase in March. The IPM has shown a robust value growth with all therapies showing a positive value growth except respiratory. Across therapy segments, the unit growth was -0.7 percent, according to data from research firm Pharmarack. “While most of the corporates have shown double digit value growth, unit growth remains a challenge,” said Sheetal Sapale, Vice President-Commercial at Pharmarack. The growth in sales in March was primarily contributed by value growth and new introductions. New introductions were primarily in the anti-diabetic segment. There were a few patent expiries from the drug innovator companies and loss of exclusivity rights in recent months in these segments recently.  Iron supplement Orofer FCM lost its exclusivity in Oct 23. Thus, there are many launches in the hematinic market for Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) products.

"Shares of oil marketing companies (OMCs) extended gains even as crude prices hovered on a five-month high. Morgan Stanley has estimated Brent crude at $90 a barrel this summer. The gains in OMC stocks despite such an outlook come on the back of favourable coverage by Nomura. The brokerage remains bullish on the prospects of the state-run refiners as it believes that the marketing overhang is now complete, while the refining outlook remains healthy. Analysts at Nomura are factoring in refining margins of $9 per barrel for FY25-26, indicating confidence in the sector's performance. The brokerage has upgraded Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) to 'buy' from 'neutral' earlier with a raised target price of Rs 570 and Rs 195. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action It also has a 'buy' rating on Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) with a raised target price of Rs 735, up from Rs 455 earlier. On the contrary, CLSA has a 'sell' call on all three leading OMCs. According to the foreign brokerage, Brent breakout at $88 per barrel is the breakeven point for marketing margins. Any additional increase in crude prices could potentially unsettle investors. There is concern regarding the possibility of marketing margins turning negative for Indian IOC, BPCL, and HPCL. Considering the upcoming general elections, it is unlikely that there will be a retail price hike, CLSA said, adding that the lack of pricing power of IOC, BPCL, and HPCL at high crude prices is expected to be exposed. As a result, CLSA maintains its sell call on IOC, BPCL, and HPCL. Rising crude prices may strain OMCs as they face higher costs in sourcing crude for refining into petrol and diesel. As crude oil prices surge, OMCs might find it challenging to fully pass on the cost hikes to consumers, given government regulations or market competition. The recent government decision to slash petrol and diesel prices by Rs 2 per litre, combined with escalating crude prices, could further squeeze OMCs' profit margins. Also Read |Oil prices ease on Gaza ceasefire possibility, dollar strength Motilal Oswal expects a negative stock price reaction for OMCs in the near term, given the retail price cut and recent elevated Brent crude prices. It has a 'buy' rating on HPCL and IOC and a 'neutral' rating on BPCL. As the impact of the Red Sea crisis on crude oil and refining GRMs wanes, the marketing margins can recover to above Rs 3 per litre again, the brokerage said. Macquarie is also bearish on OMC stocks. It has downgraded HPCL to 'neutral' from 'outperform' with a target price of Rs 425. IOC has also been downgraded to 'underperform' from 'neutral', with a target price of Rs 130.

Bank Nifty closed the day on a negative note for the seventh consecutive trading session. It has however recovered sharply from the intraday lows (46022).

Taking Stock: Market inches closer to record high amid volatility; midcap index hits fresh high Broader indices outperformed with BSE midcap index (up 0.6 percent) hitting fresh record high and smallcap index rose 1 percent.... Read More Nifty traded in a narrow range with a negative bias to close flat at 22435 levels. Broader market outperformed with the Nifty midcap 100 up 0.4% and the Nifty Smallcap 100 up 1%. Sector-wise it was a mixed bag with PSU Bank being the top gainer. Markets are trading with caution ahead of the RBI policy meeting and key macro data to be released in the US and Europe. Also, US Fed Chair Powell's speech will be keenly watched. We expect the market to consolidate over the next few days until the events unfold. Market traded volatile for yet another session and ended on a flat note, tracking mixed cues. Weak global markets triggered a gap-down start however buying in select heavyweights pared losses in no time. Consequently, Nifty retested yesterday’s high also but failed to surpass the same and eventually closed at 22,434.65 levels. Meanwhile, the sectoral indices also traded mixed wherein IT and financial services edged higher while realty and FMCG closed in the red. Interestingly, the broader indices managed to continue their outperformance and gained in the range of 0.5%-1.2%. The prevailing resilience in the index amid weak global cues shows that bulls are in control and we expect the tone to strengthen above 22,550 levels in Nifty. Traders should align their positions accordingly, with a focus on stock selection. The Nifty opened gap down and witnessed a recovery during the day to close off the intraday lows though marginally in the red down ~19 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty has been witnessing consolidation since the past three trading sessions. the momentum setup on the daily and hourly tie frame is providing divergent signal and hence can lead to a consolidation in the near term. On the downside the zone of 22400 – 22350 is acting as a support zone while 22500 – 22530 is the immediate hurdle zone. A breach on the range on either side shall result in a trending move. Bank Nifty managed to close the day in the green. The zone of 47300 – 47250 acted as a crucial support zone and absorbed the selling pressure. We expect the Bank Nifty to continue with the up-move towards 48000 – 48160 over the next few trading sessions. The Bank Nifty index experienced buying pressure from lower levels and managed to sustain above the support zone of 47500-47400. However, it faces immediate resistance at 48000, and a decisive breakthrough could trigger further short-covering rallies towards the 49000 mark. It's anticipated to consolidate within the range of 47400-48000 leading up to the RBI policy announcement, with potential trending moves expected thereafter. There is a subtle positivity in the Indian market, bucking the weak global trend, aided by positive manufacturing PMI data and optimistic expectation of upcoming Q4 results. Buoyancy of the broad market indicates strength to continue in the short-term. Meanwhile, strong US economic data has apparently cast doubts on the Fed rate cut in June anticipated by the market. Market is focused on the US FED chair’s speech, later today, for more hints. A statement in-line with the last policy is predicted to bring back a respite to the global market. Nifty remained volatile throughout the day after an initial weak start attributed to negative global cues. Despite this, the overall sentiment remains robust as the index sustains itself above key moving averages. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates bullish momentum in the short term. Over the short term, the index may trend towards 22,650. Support is positioned at 22,350 on the lower end. SJVN, formerly known as Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Indian Institute of Technology Patna (IIT Patna) to use advanced geological models in SJVN's tunnelling projects, thus significantly reducing time and cost overruns. Weak Asian and US market cues coupled with caution ahead of the RBI's monetary policy announcement on Friday saw domestic equities end flattish with a negative bias. Surging crude oil prices and uptick in US bond yields are making investors nervous with FIIs offloading local shares further dampening the sentiment. By moving in tandem with the weak global peers, Indian equities commenced the day on a tepid note but a quick recovery was seen from the lower levels, and a follow-through rally helped the Index trim all its losses; however, towards the end of the day, the Index came off from highs and finally settled at 22,434.65 with a loss of 18.65 points. Among the sectors, PSU Banking was the top performer followed by IT and Media while profit booking pressure was observed in the Realty stocks. Buying traction remained in the Broader markets as Mid and Smallcaps gained further by 0.52% & 1.16% respectively. The Index is oscillating in the range of 22,350-22,500, breakout on either side will provide proper direction. Indian rupee ended marginally lower at 83.43 per dollar versus Tuesday's close of 83.38.

Read More Nifty opened gap up today and witnessed selling pressure during the second half of the trading session which resulted into a marginal negative close for the index. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty has faced resistance at the upper end of the channel placed around 22740 – 22770. The hourly momentum indicator has triggered a negative crossover which is sign of loss of momentum. Thus, we can expect some consolidation though the overall trend is still positive, and we expect the dips towards 22600 – 22580 to be bought into. Bank Nifty also witnessed selling pressure during the second half though it managed to close the day in the green.

While fundamentals continue to be strong, stretched valuations will allow investors to book profit at regular intervals. Investors would still be mindful of rising crude prices and US Fed’s inability to cut rates amid stubborn inflation, which could fuel uncertainty going ahead. The Indian market reached a fresh intraday peak before seeing profit-booking at higher levels in anticipation of tomorrow's key US inflation data, which carries weight in determining future rate cuts by the US Fed. Concerns have emerged amidst recent better-than-anticipated US employment and manufacturing data, suggesting a potential shift in expectations regarding rate cuts this year. Moreover, escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, alongside supply concerns, have propelled crude prices upward, impacting overall market sentiment. In the near term, the focus will shift to Q4 earnings, which will kick off this weekend. Nifty opened higher but struggled to withstand the selling pressure at elevated levels. On the hourly chart, the RSI (14) indicates bearish divergence, signaling a potential shift in price momentum towards the downside. Immediate support is observed at 22,600; a decisive drop below this level could drive the index towards 22,400. Conversely, resistance is evident at 22,770 on the higher end. Nifty50 began the day at another record level of 22,700 but failed to keep the strong momentum going and remained sideways in the morning trade. Profit booking in the 2nd half of the trading session pulled the Index lower to settle the day at 22,642.75 with a minuscule loss of 23.55 points. With gains of more than 1%, the metal sector was the star performer while the realty segment extended its journey towards the north, and on the flip side, Media and PSU Banks were added to the list of underperformers. Divergence was seen in the broader market performance where Smallcaps managed to end in the green while Midcaps marginally underperformed. On the daily timeframe, the Index has made a bearish candle. Still, the overall uptrend is intact and correction if any, will provide better opportunities to enter at the lower levels. A level of 22,530 offers strong support while immediate resistance is placed at 22,780. In the fourth quarter, the anticipated corporate earnings have been a driving force behind the recent market momentum. Despite notable increases in the prices of gold, crude oil, and metals, investors are witnessing an upward trend in equity markets, and there are expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Investors may consider locking in partial profits while keeping a hold approach. Government policies and reforms have played a crucial role in fostering a stable environment conducive to market growth. Measures aimed at stimulating the economy, coupled with a focus on digitalization and infrastructure development, have attracted substantial investments. The growing involvement of retail investors, combined with sustained interest from foreign institutional investors, highlights the widespread confidence in India's growth story.

"India's benchmark Sensex and Nifty faced their first weekly decline after four weeks of gains and posted around two percent loss during the week, the steepest weekly decline in 20 weeks. Broad-based selling and a meltdown in mid and smallcap stocks continued, alarming investors amidst regulatory warnings. The benchmark Sensex lost 2.2 percent during the week while Nifty fell 2.1 percent. This was the steepest weekly fall since October 2023. BSE MidCap and SmallCap lost around 4 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Weakness in global equities, driven by discouraging US data, reduced expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, further dampening sentiments. Separate reports on Thursday revealed that US producer prices exceeded forecasts in February, while fewer individuals applied for and received jobless benefits than anticipated, weakening the case for a rate cut by the Fed. BSE MidCap and SmallCap stocks have faced heavy selling since mid-February, following SEBI's directive to mutual funds to safeguard investors amidst concerns of overheating. Analysts anticipated the decline due to inflated valuations post-2023 bull run, with BSE SmallCap up 74 percent and MidCap index over 60 percent in the past year, raising caution. The ongoing market correction is seen as healthy, aiming to balance overbought zones, analysts said. The SEBI Chairperson recently announced mandatory disclosure for mutual funds focusing on stress testing by March 15. This aims to gauge how quickly funds can exit portfolios during stress. It addresses challenges faced during redemptions in illiquid markets. The disclosure informs investors about potential outcomes in small-cap and mid-cap funds during stress. AMFI also outlined stress test guidelines for small-cap and midcap schemes, directing fund houses to submit results every 15 days, with the first report due by March 15. These tests reveal portfolio liquidity, crucial for swift investor withdrawals during market collapses and increased redemptions. Outlook for March 18 Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities: Domestic equities followed global cues as weak US and Asian markets fuelled extended profit-taking with investors selling auto, oil & gas, banking and power stocks. The recent subdued economic readings related to inflation and IIP numbers too didn't help either, which further aggravated the bearish mood during the week. With uncertainty around, local investors will closely follow global markets to decide on their exposure to equities. Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research, Religare Broking: Markets traded lackluster amid mixed cues and lost over half a percent. After the initial downtick, the Nifty inched gradually lower and almost reached closer to Thursday’s low.  Though it tried to recoup losses in the latter half, pressure on select heavyweights capped the recovery. Eventually, it settled at 22,024 level; down by 0.53 percent. Most sectors traded in line with the move and settled in the red wherein auto, energy and pharma were among the top losers. Meanwhile, the broader indices traded mixed and that resulted in neutral market breadth. Indications are in favor of consolidation with negative bias until the Nifty decisively reclaims 22,250 levels. However, the pace of decline would remain gradual citing the resilience of select heavyweights across sectors. Traders should continue with a stock-specific approach and maintain positions on both sides. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities: In the last week, the benchmark indices witnessed profit booking at higher levels, after a sharp decline the Nifty ended 2.20 percent lower while the Sensex shed over 1600 points. Among Sectors, the majority of sectoral indices witnessed profit booking at higher levels Reality and Media indices lost the most, shed nearly 9 percent. Technically, on weekly charts the index has formed a long bearish candle and it is also trading below the 20 day SMA (Simple Moving Average) which is largely negative. We are of the view that, as long as the index is trading below 20 day SMA or 22200/73200 the weak formation is likely to continue. Below the same, the market could slip till 21800-21700/72000-71700. On the flip side, for the bulls 22150/73000 and 22200/73200- or 20-day SMA would be the key resistance areas. Fresh uptrend rally possible only after dismissal of 20 day SMA or 73200. Above the same, it could retest the level of 22300-22350/73500-73700 For Bank Nifty, 50 day SMA or 46500 would act as a sacrosanct zone, above the same, it could move up till 47200-47500. On the other side, below 50 day SMA uptrend would be vulnerable. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities: The Nifty has once again closed below the rising trendline, bringing market sentiment back into a state of weakness. The momentum indicator suggests bearish momentum in the near term. Immediate support is situated at the 50DMA, currently at 21,900, which is expected to provide support for the Nifty. A decisive drop below 21,900 could lead to a sharp decline in the index. On the upside, resistance is observed in the range of 22,200-22,250.
","Sensex and Nifty Weekly Performance: Sensex lost 2.2% during the week, while Nifty fell 2.1%. This was the steepest weekly decline since October 2023. Broad-based selling and a meltdown in mid and smallcap stocks continued.Global Market Context: US producer prices exceeded forecasts in February, which reduced expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Weaknesses in global equities, driven by discouraging US data, further dampened sentiments.Market Analysis: The ongoing market correction is seen as healthy, aiming to balance overbought zones. Analysts anticipate the decline due to inflated valuations post-2023 bull run. The recent subdued economic readings related to inflation and IIP numbers further aggravated the bearish mood during the week.Outlook for March 18: The Nifty is expected to close below the 22,250 levels, with a potential for further decline if the momentum indicator suggests bearish momentum. The Sensex could retest the level of 22300-22350 if the 20-day SMA holds above the resistance zone.Additional Points: Separate reports on Thursday revealed that US producer prices exceeded forecasts in February, which reduced expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.

Several of them took to the social media platform X and said the bank's executives had been calling ICICI Securities' stakeholders to influence their voting. The stock exchanges even wrote to ICICI Securities and ICICI Bank to provide a clarification on the same. Quantum Mutual Fund, which holds a minor stake in ICICI Securities, earlier voted against the proposal saying that the move would be detrimental to the interests of the fund house’s unitholders. Quantum Mutual Fund estimated that the merger will result in a net loss of at least Rs 6.08 crore to its unitholders. In its rationale, the fund house believes that ICICI Bank's proposal undervalues ICICI Securities (ISEC) and gives ICICI Bank access to the full business of ISEC at a less than the fair market price.

"With China’s deflation at its worst in 15 years, a volatile stock market and bank interest rates too low for her liking, 18-year-old Tina Hong is placing her financial security in gold beans. Weighing as little as one gram, the beans — and other forms of gold jewelry — are increasingly viewed as the safest investment bet for young Chinese in an era of economic uncertainty. It’s part of a larger consumer trend for all things gold — from bullion to beans and bracelets — that has gripped the mainland. “It’s basically impossible to lose money from buying gold,” reasoned Hong, a college freshman studying computer science in Fujian province who in January began buying gold beans because of their relatively low cost of about 600 yuan ($83) per gram. She has more than two grams of the beans and will continue buying them as long as costs are lower than international gold prices, she said. Branded as an investment entry point for young consumers, the beans, which come in glass jars, are the latest hot-selling items in Chinese jewelry stores. Generation Z consumers — buffeted by high youth unemployment and the nation’s slide into deflation — are now among the top consumers of gold accessories in the world’s second-largest economy, according to the 2023 China Jewelry Consumer Trends Report by Chow Tai Fook Jewelery Group Ltd. The attraction of gold comes as people pull back on shopping amid months of disappointing growth. China Gold Rush A lack of faith in traditional investments has fueled this new China gold rush. The nation’s stock market has seen declines after reopening from the pandemic, with one of its key benchmarks dropping to levels last seen in 2018. The country’s middle class is bearing the brunt of a property downturn — while the central bank has lowered a key interest rate four times since December 2021, eating into the return on wealth management products. Young people are skipping “pleasurable consumption” and instead purchasing “asset-style jewelry” such as gold beans for adornment and investments, said Nikos Kavalis, managing director at the London-based consultancy Metals Focus Ltd. However, he cautions that it makes no sense to invest in gold beans — or other gold items — because their price is often 10% to 30% higher than the commodity’s spot price. Investors would be better served by parking money in gold ETFs, he said. Still, the fascination with gold is sweeping across social media. On Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of X, formerly Twitter, the hashtag “Why Are Young People Getting into Buying Gold” garnered 91 million hits. A lively discussion about the enduring value of gold dominates the social media site, with one popular post stating that “buying gold keeps troubles at bay.” Three-quarters of gold consumers are now estimated to be between 25 and 35 years old and many believe investing in gold is low-risk, according to a 2021 report from the World Gold Council. That belief is reinforced as gold prices have hit multiple historic highs since December. Gold bullion passed the $2,100 per ounce threshold for the first time this month. Sales of gold, silver and jewelery reached a six-year high in December, a 29.4% year-on-year jump, according to government data. Precious metals now represent one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in China. Buying gold beans for gifting and investments also reached a peak during China’s lunar new year, says a spokesperson from Chinese jeweler Luk Fook Holdings International Ltd. Even banks have joined traditional gold retailers to sell gold beans. China Merchants Bank Co., for example, introduced its line of gold bean sets in July 2023. “Despite the recent surge in China’s gold price, consumers are still demonstrating a strong preference for gold,” said Cindy Yeung, chairwoman and managing director of Emperor Watch & Jewellery Ltd. Like other major jewelry retailers, Emperor is talking up gold on social media and e-commerce platforms. Impure Beans There are perils for consumers of gold beans and other gold objects who aren’t knowledgeable about the difference between authentic gold and fakes, experts say. Lily Chen, a 26-year-old Shanghai office worker, discovered almost all of the gold beans she had purchased were mixed with iron, zinc and copper when she recently tried to exchange them for a gold bracelet. “I never tried cutting corners by buying gold at ultra-cheap prices, and I made sure to buy from star-rated web stores. But this could still happen,” she said.

"With a staggering gain of 164 percent over the past year, does electronics manufacturer Dixon Technology's Ismartu acquisition have enough steam to carry forward the rally? On April 8, the company signed a share-purchase agreement with Ismartu, a Noida-based company that makes, assembles, sells, distributes, imports and exports mobile phones and other electronics. WhileDixon Technologies'acquisition of Ismartu, which is the manufacturing arm of Transsion Holdings, at an attractive valuation will help it further expand in the domestic smartphone market, Kotak Institutional Equities has reiterated its “sell” call on the stock with a price target of Rs 5,200. The price target is higher than the previous time but still implies a 32 percent downside from the current levels. This is because the brokerage valuations are expensive and the target price already factors in the company's electronics manufacturing services segment (EMS), components and exports, the Kotak report said. ""We lower our FY24 earnings estimate by 8 percent and raise our FY25 and FY26 estimates by 9 and 6 percent, respectively, owing to an expected ramp-up in the mobile segment, driven by the Ismartu acquisition,"" Kotak analysts said. In the December quarter, the company signed an agreement to manufacture mobile phones for Compal, a Taiwanese computer manufacturer, and its designated customers targeting the domestic Indian market. The move also holds the potential for expansion into the export market over the medium term.

Its plan to collaborate with local contract manufacturers reflects a strategic move to bolster domestic manufacturing capabilities. Should this collaboration materialise, Dixon stands to gain from increased volumes, potentially leading to a broader market share in the domestic mobile manufacturing sector. The partnership presents promising avenues for growth and expansion for Dixon, Kotak said in the note. In the third quarter, the company's consumer electronics and home appliance business clocked modest revenue growth because of competitive intensity. Lighting segment continued to face pressure due to weakened consumer demand, which resulted in on-year de-growth.

"Volatility ensued domestic markets in the week ended March 15 due to a broad-based selloff in mid- and small-cap pockets amid concerns of frothy valuations. In the coming week, the US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, macro-data, and more stress test results from mutual fund houses are expected to keep markets on tenterhooks, said analysts, advising investors to buy-on-every dip. Frontline indices Sensex and Nifty declined 2 percent each last week, while broader markets - the BSE Smallcap and the BSE Midcap - slipped up to 6 percent. All the sectors traded in the red, except IT and Consumer goods, with maximum fall seen in Oil & Gas, Construction, and Media. In the coming week, the market is expected react to the US Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan's interest rate decisions. Other than that, important macro-economic data of major countries and S&P Global manufacturing and services PMIs of India, UK, and the US will also be watched out for. ""The week ahead, the global central bank’s monetary policy decision will get investor attention. The US Fed, Bank of Japan, and Bank of England will unveil their rate decisions. There is uncertainty over Fed rate cuts due to an increase in the US unemployment rate and higher-than-expected US inflation. Consequently, the US 10-year yield and dollar index inched higher, and the repercussions were visible in the emerging markets as well,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. Here are the top 10 factors that will garner a market reaction: 1. US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision The US Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rate unchanged in the range of 5.25-5.5 percent, according to economists' predictions. Other than this, market participants will keenly track economic projections and interest rate cut forecast. According to aReuterspoll, economists predicted the US Fed to start cutting interest rates in June 2024 as the central bank awaits more data to confirm whether inflation is heading convincingly towards the 2 percent target. In February, the US consumer price index rose to 3.2 percent, slightly above market expectations of 3.1 percent. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, increased 0.4 percent from the last month and 3.8 percent from a year ago. The movement in US bond yields and dollar index post US Fed's interest rate decision will also influence equity trends. On March 15, the US 10-year bond yield stood around 4.3 percent, while the US dollar index hovered around the 103 level. Global factors Apart from this, the Bank of Japan and Bank of England will also announce their monetary policy decisions. Additionally, investors will track the UK producer price index and the S&P Global Manufacturing & Services PMI.  Domestic factors Back home, India's Services PMI data will also be released. Additionally, market participants will watch out for the bank loan and deposit growth as it will determine the sector's performance going ahead. India will also release its foreign exchange reserves data. Stress test results Several mutual fund houses released their liquidity stress test results following Sebi's mandate to Association of Mutual Funds India (AMFI). The move comes on the back of market regulator SEBI’s concern over froth in these schemes amid relentless flow despite large fund houses restricting inflows due to lack of investment opportunity at the right valuation. Nippon India Small Cap Fund, which runs the biggest small-cap scheme with Rs 46,000 crore worth of assets under management (AUM), said it will need 27 days to sell off half of its portfolio. Edelweiss Mutual Fund said it would take two days to liquidate 50 percent of the portfolio. All these mutual fund houses need to publish their stress test results every 15 days beginning March 15. IPO & listing After weeks of back-to-back IPOs, primary markets will see some calm this week. Mainboard IPO Krystal Integrated Services will close its subscription on March 18. On the second day of bidding, the IPO was subscribed by 70 percent. The company will debut exchanges on March 21, 2024. Apart from that, SME IPO Vishwas Agri Seeds will open for subscription on March 21 and close on March 26. Vishwas Agri Seeds operates within the agricultural sector, specialising in the processing and distribution of seeds to farmers through an extensive network. The company offers a diverse range of crop seeds, including Groundnut, Soybean, Wheat, Cumin, Green Gram, and Black Gram. FII flow Market participants will watch out for foreign flows this week following Sebi's approval of a raft of relaxations for foreign portfolio investors, alternative investment funds, and entities seeking to raise funds through initial share sales, as part of facilitating the ease of doing business in the securities market. So far in March, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) bought equities worth Rs 40,710 crore. On March 15, FIIs bought Rs 848 crore worth of equities, while DIIs sold Rs 682 crore worth of equities. Technical View Analysts expect markets to experience further downward pressure in the coming week after the break of dual support, that is, 20-DEMA and rising trendline on the daily chart. ""A breakdown below the previous swing low i.e. 21,850 could result in the next leg of down move to 21,500. The view would be negated if it manages to cross and hold decisively above the 22,250 level. Among the key sectors, IT and FMCG look comparatively stronger while others may continue to trade mixed. Amid all, we reiterate our preference for index majors and suggest maintaining positions on both sides,"" said Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice-President of Technical Research at Religare Broking. Oil Prices Brent crude futures, the international oil benchmark, finally closed above the key hurdle, i.e. $84 a barrel, after several weeks of consolidation. In fact, the price has seen a breakout of downward sloping resistance trendline, though the volume was lower than average. Brent crude futures closed at $85.34 a barrel, up 4 percent on weekly basis. Brent may face the next resistance at $88 a barrel, with support at around $80 a barrel, experts said. Oil prices have reacted positively to the bullish demand outlook for crude oil in 2024 from the leading energy research houses (OPEC, EIA and IEA) and further hinting of supply deficit of 0.3-0.5 mbpd during the course of the year. Hence, ""we see oil prices head for further upside in short to medium term. All the major correction should be considered as buying opportunities,"" Mohammed Imran, research analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said. F&O Cues and India VIX Considering the volatile trade with negative bias, the options data indicated that 21,800 is expected to be key support for the Nifty 50 in the coming days, with crucial hurdle on the higher side at 22,300. On the weekly options front, the maximum Call open interest was seen at 23,000 strike, followed by 22,500 strike and 22,000 strike, with meaningful Call writing at 22,000 strike, then 22,100 & 22,300 strikes, while on the Put side, the 21,000 strike owned the maximum open interest, followed by 22,000 & 21,800 strikes, with writing at 21,000 strike, then 21,800 strike. The volatility increased a bit after a sharp fall in the previous week, but remained below the 14 mark on the weekly basis, hence it is not worrisome for bulls. India VIX, the fear gauge, rose 0.57 percent to 13.69 from 13.61 levels. If the VIX spikes above the 16 mark, then bulls may turn uncomfortable, experts said. Corporate Action Here are key corporate actions taking place next week

"PSU Bank stocks rallied on April 1, pushing the Nifty PSU index up by over a percent. The current benign credit environment has supported asset quality of these banks, helping the stocks to rise, analysts said. Bank of America (BoFA) Securities is bullish on smaller PSU banks, citing better risk-reward on higher earnings growth and valuation upside. According to BofA Securities, consensus estimates for FY25 remain conservative for PSU banks, suggesting potential for EPS upgrades ranging from 10 to 20 percent, driven by increased confidence in the consistency of earnings per share and Return on Assets (RoA) delivery, coupled with a rise in foreign ownership.

"Nifty IT will put up a strong show in the short term as it has rebounded from the crucial support zone of 36,600, which is 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level for the recent swing from 30,054 to 38,559, anticipates Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities. The deputy vice-president and head of the technical and derivative research desk at SBI Securities believes that the Nifty IT index will test the 38,500 level in the short term. Seasoned for more than 15 years in technical and derivatives research, Shah estimates that the 21,900 - 21,850 zone will be crucial support for the Nifty 50. Sustaining below 21,850 will lead to an extension of the correction up to 21,500 in the short term, he said. Here's the excerpts from an interaction on the market withMoneycontrol: Do you think the Nifty has entered the consolidation mode with support at 21,860 or there is a possibility of another round of correction up to 21,500 in the coming sessions? Last week, ended March 15, after a rising channel breakdown in the Nifty on the daily scale, the index has taken support around 21,900-21,930 zone as it is the confluence of 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) and the prior swing low. Apart from Nifty index trading below its 20-day EMA level, the 20-day EMA has started edging lower. The charts of large-cap stocks display a mixed picture in addition to some weakness being observed in the momentum indicators and oscillators for the Nifty. Hence, we feel that these factors are hinting at a possible consolidation for the Nifty in the near term. The 21,900 - 21,850 zone will be a crucial support for the index. Sustaining below 21,850 will lead to an extension of the correction up to 21,500 levels in the short term. On the upside, the zone of 22,200-22,250 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index. Sustaining above the 22,250 level, the index would resume its journey up to 22,530-22,700. Stocks that look structurally strong, especially after the recent steep fall... Based on relative strength charts, large-caps such as Ambuja Cements, Bharti Airtel, Cipla, Colpal, HDFC AMC, Nestle India and TCS look structurally strong with promising signs of outperformance, while Persistent Systems, Dixon Technologies and L&T Technology Services look strong from the mid-cap space. Also read:What should you do with your mid and small-cap holdings amid heightened volatility? Experts weigh in Do you think the worst is over for midcap and smallcap indices? After the fierce sell-off in the first half of the week ended March 15, the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices have seen minor pullback in the last two trading sessions. But the worst is not over. We feel underperformance in these indices when compared to Nifty would continue. One needs to be extremely stock-specific and choose the stocks wisely, which are structurally strong on charts backed by strong fundaments. For the Midcap index, we feel that the 100-day EMA zone of 45,300-45,500 could act as an important support, while 47,400-47,500 zone would act as a potential resistance on the upside. The Nifty Smallcap index is relatively weaker than Midcap index. While the Midcap index is 6 percent down from its all-time high, the Smallcap barometer has corrected over 12 percent from its highs. We expect the index to consolidate negatively between 20 DEMA zone of 15,300 on the upside and 13,900 on the downside.

Looking at the ratio chart of Nifty Private Bank index to Nifty PSU Bank index, clear signs of outperformance by private banks are visible since past few trading sessions. Tracking the levels, the Nifty Private Bank index has key supports placed at 22,800-23,000 zone, which is the 200-day EMA Level as well as the upward sloping trendline zone. The charts of heavyweight stocks such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank in the Nifty Private Banks index show promising signs. PSU Bank Index, which has breached its recent swing low, needs to cross and sustain above its 10-20 EMA zone of 6,950-7,000 zone for it to witness a resurgence in momentum on the upside.

Additionally, during the recent downturn in frontline indices, Nifty IT has exhibited higher relative strength with the ratio chart of Nifty IT to Nifty forming a sequence of higher highs and higher lows since last five trading sessions indicating its potential for outperformance in the current market conditions.

"Reliance Industries shares jumped over 3 percent on March 27 after Goldman Sachs reiterated a ‘buy’ rating on Reliance Industries Ltd, with as much as a 54 percent upside by FY26 in its bull case, citing favourable risk-reward dynamics, value unlocking from its Disney joint venture, and enhanced return on capital investments. With the capex cycle in two capital-intensive businesses, retail and Jio Telecom, reaching its peak, RIL will now start seeing improvements in its overall performance, said Goldman Sachs analysts. The brokerage raised the target price on theRILstock to Rs 4,495 in the bull case and Rs 3,400 in the base case, implying a 17 percent return from the previous closing price. Reliance Industries shares tend to outperform the Indian market under two conditions: expanding returns and valuation discovery through stake sales in newer businesses, the brokerage said. “Over the last two years, both these drivers were largely absent, potentially driving the shares’ underperformance. We expect rising returns ahead, which could compound with further potential value unlock through potential listings of consumer businesses,” the note said. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action RIL returns at inflection point Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that RIL’s consolidated returns are at an inflection point in FY24, and its Cash Return on Cash Invested (CROCI) will expand by nearly 270 basis points to 12 percent in FY27, which will be the highest since 2011. The brokerage noted that RIL is coming out of a series of long and intensive capex cycles. Reliance Industries has invested over $125 billion in capex over the last decade, mostly in hydrocarbon and telecom, which are more capex-intensive and have a longer gestation period of over five years. The businesses RIL is investing more in over the next three years are relatively less capex heavy, higher in returns, and have a shorter gestation period, it said. RIL earnings profile to grow stronger Goldman Sachs expects Reliance Retail’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to nearly double during FY24-27, with the share of consolidated EBITDA increasing to 14.3 percent in FY27 from 12.4 percent in FY23. For the new energy vertical, the brokerage expects positive EBITDA contribution to begin from FY25 and reach $2.3 billion by FY30. On a consolidated basis, analysts at Goldman Sachs expect RIL’s free cash flow, which has largely remained negative due to the elevated capex, to turn positive in FY25 with capex likely peaking out, while EBITDA may expand by 20 percent on-year, led by a telecom tariff hike, higher retail same-store sales growth and a recovery in chemical margins. A 17 percent annual increase in EBITDA between FY24 and FY27 is expected, driven by Retail EBITDA nearly doubling during this period, and a 22 percent annual EBITDA growth in the telecom business, driven by higher telecom ARPU. The continued shift of consumers to smartphones, robust growth in fixed broadband, recovery in petrochemical margins, driven by global demand and lower feedstock prices, along with sustained strength in diesel cracks due to limited global spare capacity, coupled with operational expenditure reduction, will also support high double-digit EBITDA growth, the analysts said. So far this year, RIL shares have rallied 11.5 percent, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50, which has risen a little over 1 percent during this period.

"The Nifty ended lower on March 15 on mixed global cues, amid selling in heavyweights across sectors even though smallcaps managed to clock gains. After a smart pullback in the previous session, the Nifty50 made a weak start and extended the losses as the day progressed. It sank to the day’s low of 21,931.70, and managed to move above 22,100 but again slipped. It ended the day at 22,023.30, down 123.40 points, or 0.56 percent, from the previous close.

The 40-day exponential average (21,970) absorbed the selling pressure, said Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. “So, until this zone is held, we can expect the upside momentum to resume. In terms of levels, 22,215 – 22,250 is the immediate hurdle zone, while 21,900 – 21,860 is the crucial support,"" he said. Nifty Bank remained volatile and moved in the 46,310.50-46,802.55 range.

"Geojit's report on Daily Agri Picks The Solvent Extractors' Association of India has urged the government to direct agencies to set up procurement centres at major mandis to procure mustard seed at the minimum support price. Such a move will ensure market stability and the welfare of farmers, the association's president, Ajay Jhunjhunwala, wrote in the letter. Currently, market prices of mustard are below the minimum support price of 5,650 rupees per 100 kg, and this necessitates immediate government intervention,the association said. On Thursday, prices in Jaipur were 5,475-5,500 rupees per 100 kg, according to traders. Minimum support price remains a concern, as the oilseed harvesting season is underway, SEA said.""Despite reaching a peak of 100 lakh (10 mln) hectares in acreage during the current season, mustard cultivation faces stagnation due to declining prices,"" it said. India has maintained a policy of free export of oilseeds, oilmeals, and edible oil alongside unrestricted import capabilities that affect the domestic market negatively. Excess imports have led to surplus inventory, posing a challenge to both the government and the industry. ""Import dependency for edible oils continues to escalate annually, with last year witnessing imports of 165 lakh tonnes (16.5 mln tn) valued at Rs. 1.4 lakh crores (1.4 trln rupees),"" he SEA said. Farmers in the country have sown summer crops across 4.1 mln ha as of today, down nearly 3% from a year ago, data from the agriculture ministry showed. The acreage under crops at this time last year was 4.2 mln ha. Acreage under pulses was up 28% on year at 642,000 ha with sowing of urad rising 27% from last year to 192,000 mln tn. The acreage under moongalso rose 28% to 433,000 ha from last year. Rice acreage rose 10% on year to 2.8 mln ha. Acreage of oilseeds was at 671,000 ha, up 10% from the previous year. The government has not yet updated the acreage for coarse cereals such as maize, jowar, and ragi, in this week's crop report for summer.

The Sensex was down 240.66 points, or 0.32 percent, at 73,986.97, and the Nifty was down 78.20 points, or 0.35 percent, at 22,436.50. The market breadth was in favour of gainers, as around 1,496 shares advanced, 1,020 declined and 116 were unchanged.

Taking Stock: Nifty hits fresh record high, Sensex up 354 pts; eyes on FOMC minutes, US CPI Except pharma, all other sectoral indices ended in the green with media, PSU Bank, FMCG, metal, oil & gas stocks were up 1-2 percent.... Read More The Indian rupee remained relatively stable, recording minor gains of 0.02 at 83.22. This sideways trend persisted, with the dollar index awaiting fresh triggers from the upcoming US CPI numbers scheduled for Wednesday evening. The strength of the Indian economy is expected to support the rupee, while global geopolitical tensions may exert pressure. Rupee's support levels are anticipated at 83.45-83.55, with resistance levels at 83.15-83.20. Markets edged higher and gained nearly half a percent, in continuation of the prevailing trend. After the initial gap-up move, Nifty remained range bound for most of the session and finally settled at 22,753.80 levels. Meanwhile, the majority of sectors were aligned with the move wherein FMCG, metal and energy were among the top gainers. The broader indices also edged higher after two days of pause and gained in the range of 0.7%-0.9%. The rotational buying across sectors combined with stability at the global front is helping the index to inch higher with every passing day. We are eyeing the 22,850-23,100 zone in Nifty ahead and expect the 22,350-22,500 zone would act as a strong support in case of any profit taking. The beginning of the earnings season would trigger stock-specific volatility ahead, so participants should plan their positions accordingly. On April 10, Indian benchmark indices concluded on a positive note, with the Nifty reaching a fresh record high. At the close, the Sensex surged by 354.45 points or 0.47 percent, settling at 75,038.15, while the Nifty climbed by 111.00 points or 0.49 percent, reaching 22,753.80. The Nifty commenced the session with a gap up opening and steadily advanced throughout the day, ultimately securing gains of approximately 111 points. Notably, it concluded above the previous swing high of 22,768.4, indicating a bullish sentiment. Both the daily and hourly momentum indicators exhibited a positive crossover, signaling a buy opportunity. Additionally, the daily Bollinger bands displayed an expansion, suggesting increased range, and with prices trending along the upper band, the possibility of sustained upward movement in the forthcoming trading sessions is implied. Regarding resistance levels, the immediate hurdle stands at 22,800, with further potential upside momentum likely towards 23,000. On the downside, support is observed at 22,650 – 22,600. Analyzing the Open Interest (OI) data, the call side exhibits the highest OI at 23,000, followed by the 22,900 strike prices, serving as robust resistance levels for the Nifty. Conversely, the highest OI on the put side is observed at the 22,700 strike price, indicating a support level. This data suggests a sideways movement scenario for the Nifty. Following the GIFT Nifty indication, Indian bourses commenced the day on a firm note around 22,700, and remained range bound till the afternoon session. A sharp uptick in the Banking and FMCG counters pushed the Index higher to settle the weekly expiry day at a record closing of 22,753.80 with gains of 111.05 points. Apart from Banking, Metal stocks contributed the most to the Index rally, and on the flip side, Pharma and Auto were the losers in today's trade. With gains of 0.97% & 0.73%, Mid and Small Caps outperform the Nifty50. The overall chart set-up of Nifty50 is strong and indicates an extension of the current up move to achieve a psychological target of 23,000 with the downside being protected at 22,530. The Nifty mostly remained sideways today as investors preferred to wait ahead of the US CPI inflation data, which could potentially impact rate cuts by the Fed. The resistance zone is placed at 22,700-22,750, while support is at 22,600. A decisive move above 22,750 might induce a rally towards 23,000 in the short term. Since the market appears to be range-bound, buying on dips and selling on rallies might prove to be a good strategy with proper stop-loss measures. Fitch cut its outlook on China's sovereign credit rating to negative on Wednesday, citing risks to public finances as the economy faces increasing uncertainty in its shift to new growth models. The outlook downgrade follows a similar move by Moody's in December and comes as Beijing ratchets up efforts to spur a feeble post-COVID recovery in the world's second-largest economy with fiscal and monetary support. The Bank Nifty index remained in consolidation mode at elevated levels, struggling to close above the 49,000 mark. Immediate support rests at 48,500, with resistance at 49,000. Any decisive move beyond these levels is expected to trigger trending moves. The index maintains a buy-on-dip stance, with 48,500 acting as a crucial support level to cushion against any downturns. Indian markets sustained their upward momentum, buoyed by a robust performance in the broader market, albeit slightly lagging behind its Asian and European counterparts. Investor attention remains fixated on the impending release of the FOMC minutes and US inflation data later today. Following the release of strong US job data, market sentiments are inclined towards an anticipation of spike inflation, thereby reducing the likelihood of a near-term rate cut. Additionally, Fitch's recent downgrade of China's credit rating could potentially reverberate through the global economy, warranting a caution.

Nuvama expects Eicher Motors' revenue growth will be bolstered by improved volume and realisation. The expansion of EBITDA margin is anticipated due to enhanced net pricing and product mix. Robust growth in profit after tax (PAT) is likely, driven by a higher share of profits from the commercial vehicle subsidiary (VECV).

"Grasim's recently launched paint brand Birla Opus unveiled its dealer pricing which happens to sit at a discount of around 5 percent for most products to industry leader Asian Paints. Factoring in promotion volumes, brokerage firm Jefferies noted that the total gap appears to be broadly 10-15 percent across segments except in luxury, where the prices are broadly similar to the market leader. With the discounted offering from Grasim, Jefferies sees the battle intensifying in the Indian paints sector, which also poses a downside risk to market leader Asian Paints. Accordingly, Jefferies expects Asian Paints' earnings-per-stock to remain flattish over the next two years due to a rise in competition and sees downside risk to its already below consensus' forecasts. Jefferies has an 'underperform' call onAsian Paintswith a price target of Rs 2,500, which reflects a downside potential of over 12 percent from the previous close. On the other hand, the firm assigned a 'buy' call forGrasim, with a price target of Rs 2,600 which factors in the scope of around 17 percent upside in the stock. Also Read |As Grasim gears up to launch Birla Opus, Jefferies turns bearish on Asian Paints Well prepared Meanwhile, Jefferies also believes that Grasim has entered the paints segment with full preparation across all fronts. Birla Opus' product range straddles across price points and has a portfolio of 1,200 SKUs (Stock keeping units), 145 products, and over 2,300 shades. ""The company has even made claims of 98 percent product superiority over competition per blind tests,"" Jefferies noted. The company's entry in the paints industry will also increase the sector's capacity by 40 percent by FY25 and also offers a potential to further add 500 million litres in the medium term. The brokerage also believes that the use of latest technology and automation should show up in lower costs for Grasim along with high backward integration. Grasim also aims to set up a pan-India distribution by July 2024 and onboard 50,000 dealers by March 2025 to develop the second largest network in the paints sector. Moreover, the company is also offering a 10 percent extra product discount during the promotional period. Absolute advertising spends are expected to be similar to Asian Paints and 3-4x the next two players, Jefferies highlighted. The company has also focused on strengthening its organisational structure as it already has 2,400 employees onboard as compared to 4,000-7,000 for industry peers Asian Paints and Berger Paints.

"Geojit's report on Daily Agri Picks The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Food Price Index was at 118.3 points in March, up 1.1% from the revised level for February, the agency said in a report. The index was down 9.9 points or 7.7% from a year ago. ""Increases in the price indices for vegetable oils, dairy products, and meat have slightly more than offset a decrease in those for sugar and cereals,"" FAO said. The cereal price index fell 2.6% on month and 20% on year to 110.8 points in March. The decline can be attributed to a drop in global wheat prices for the third consecutive month in March, primarily due to strong competition among European Union countries, Russia, and the US in terms of exports. Ample supplies from Australia and the US amid cancelled wheat purchases by China, also contributed to the decline in prices, the report said. Maize export prices edged marginally upwards on month due to more buying by China. ""Logistical difficulties in Ukraine and elsewhere also provided some support to maize prices, although it was countered by seasonal pressure in Argentina and Brazil where harvests are underway,"" the report said. Global prices of barley fell, while those of sorghum increased in March. The FAO All Rice Price Index declined 1.7% in March, largely reflecting subdued global import demand, it said. The vegetable oil price index was up 8% month-onmonth at 130.6 points in March, at a one-year-high. ""The marked rebound reflected higher price quotations across palm, soy, sunflower and rapeseed oils,"" FAO said. International palm oil prices continued to increase in March, underpinned by seasonally lower output in leading producing countries, which coincided with firm domestic demand in southeast Asia. However, global prices of soyoil recovered from multi-year lows, mostly due to robust demand from the biofuel sector, particularly in the US and Brazil. Similarly, sunflower and rapeseed oil prices recovered amid rising global import demand. Higher crude oil prices also contributed to the increase in vegetable oil prices, according to the report. The dairy price index was up 2.9% on month at 124.2 points in March, marking the second consecutive monthly increase, though it was down 8.2% on year. In March, global cheese prices rose the most, reflecting the steady import demand from Asia, higher sales in western Europe and a seasonal drop in production in Oceania. International butter prices increased further in March, mainly due to good seasonal demand and somewhat tighter stocks in Europe. The meat price index was up 1.7% on month at 113.0 points in March, the second consecutive monthly increase. On year, it was down 1.5%. International poultry meat prices increased in March, underpinned by steady demand from leading importing countries. Prices of pork also increased, mainly reflecting higher internal demand ahead of the Easter holidays, notwithstanding increased supplies, especially in Western Europe. ""World bovine meat prices continued to rise in March, mainly due to increased purchases by leading importing countries,"" the agency said. The sugar price index fell 5.4% on month to 133.1 points in March after two consecutive monthly increases due to a decline in international sugar price quotations, mainly driven by the upward revision of the 2023-24 sugar production forecast in India and the improved pace of sugar harvest in Thailand at the final stage of the season.On year, however, sugar prices were up 4.8%. Persisting concerns over the crop in Brazil, negatively affected by prolonged dry weather conditions, continued to exacerbate seasonal trends and limit the drop in prices. Higher international crude oil prices also helped limit the fall in global sugar prices, the report said.

Taking Stock: Market nears record high on final trading day of FY24 For the March F&O series and for a month, the Nifty50 index gained 1.6 percent, while in the FY24 the index surged by 28.6 percent... Read More While markets may witness wild fluctuations due to valuations of benchmark indices being in an expensive zone, the undertone still remains bullish as investors are willing to bet big on equity assets for the next financial year too. While focus will shift to full year earnings from next month, sectors like banking and IT companies will be in focus going ahead. Although corrections at every interval will provide investors an opportunity to revisit mid & small-cap stocks, large-cap stocks could attract more attention going ahead. Today being the last day of FY24, it makes sense to analyze what worked and what didn't in this fiscal. It was one of the best years for Indian markets. Nifty was one of the best-performing markets in Asia with almost 29% USD return (next to Japan). China and HK were big underperformers. In India, it was more of the Mid and Small-cap Index that gave phenomenal returns relative to Nifty, almost 2.2-2.4x returns. despite some corrections in the last month. Within the broader index, it was mainly PSU stocks, auto, energy, and pharma that have given good returns, whereas consumer and Pvt banks have struggled while the IT sector has broadly remained a silent spectator. FII we're active on both sides but will end the year on a positive note whereas DII who pumped a big chunk of money into the market, gave a good fillip. Nifty & Nifty Bank register gains over 2% for two straight series 31 Nifty stocks give positive returns; HDFC Life, L&T, Eicher, Hero MotoCorp, Kotak Bank, ITC, IndusInd & Titan are amongst top Nifty Gainers TCS, Dr Reddy’s, Shriram Finance & SBI Life are top Nifty losers Nifty rises 30% in FY24 to post biggest returns (ex-covid year) since 2010 All sectoral indices rise In FY24; Realty, PSU, Power & Auto gain the most 48 of 50 Nifty stocks give positive returns in FY24, 5 of them have doubled Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Adani Ports, Coal India & Hero MotoCorp rise over 100% each 11 Nifty stocks gain in the range of 60-90% in this fiscal Only 2 Nifty stocks (HDFC Bank & HUL) give negative returns in FY24  Indian equities closed the day and fiscal year on an optimistic note, with volatility by the end of the session, as buying by retails, DIIs, and FIIs surged across categories. The mid- and small-cap stocks have emerged as frontrunners, rebounding from the initial sell-off earlier in the month. An upgrade in the domestic economy forecast hints at an encouraging outlook for the stock market in FY25. However, the emphasis is on large-cap due to the persisting premium valuations of mid-cap stocks, which could pose a concern on the broad market in the short to medium term. After a period of bullish resurgence, the Bank Nifty index exhibited strength by surpassing the 20-day moving average hurdle set at 47,000, backed by significant volumes. Despite this, it faced resistance around the 47,500 mark. A decisive breach above this resistance could propel the index towards the 48,000 level. Conversely, the immediate support is situated at the 47,000-46,800 zone. A conclusive drop below this support level, especially on a closing basis, might indicate a false breakout scenario. The Nifty has rallied significantly, surpassing the 22,500 mark after maintaining momentum beyond 22,100. Furthermore, there's a clear breakout in consolidation on the daily timeframe, signaling rising optimism. Nevertheless, the Nifty encountered initial resistance near its previous swing high of 22,526. Consequently, to sustain a continued rally, it must surpass the 22,525 level decisively. On the downside, 22,200 could serve as short-term support. The rupee traded with weakness as the strength of the dollar index exerted pressure. The rupee dropped to 83.40, down 0.07rs, while the dollar index traded with gains of 0.40$ at 104.40$, surpassing the resistance of 104$. Additionally, the rise in crude oil prices further contributed to the weakness in the rupee. Indian rupee ended marginally lower at 83.40 per dollar versus Previous close of 83.37. Market extended the winning run on the second consecutive day on March 28 with benchmark indices went closer to record high. At close, the Sensex was up 655.04 points or 0.90 percent at 73,651.35, and the Nifty was up 203.20 points or 0.92 percent at 22,326.90.

Nifty after a subdued start edged higher to close with gains of 85 points (+0.4%) at 22097 levels. Broader market too ended in the green. Barring IT, all sectors ended in green with Auto, Pharma, and Realty being top gainers. IT sector saw some selling after US technology major Accenture lowered its revenue forecast for FY24. Accenture revised its full-year revenue growth projection at 1 % to 3 % from 2 % to 5 %. Markets opened weak but soon gained momentum including broader space amid positive cues. Next week being a truncated week and the derivatives' monthly expiry, we might see some volatility while Nifty is likely to consolidate at higher levels. Also, US GDP data and other key economic data would keep investors busy. Taking Stock: Sensex gains 191 points, Nifty at 22,100; auto, realty shine, IT drags Top Nifty gainers included UPL, Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and Sun Pharma, while losers were Wipro, Infosys, LTIMindtree, HCL Technologies and TCS... Read More Markets traded volatile but managed to end higher, tracking favorable global cues. After the initial downtick, Nifty inched gradually higher for most of the session however profit taking in the final hour trimmed the gains. Eventually, it settled at 22096.75; up by 0.39%. Meanwhile, a majority of sectors ended higher wherein realty, auto and pharma were among the top performers. The broader indices also extended rebound and gained over half a percent each. Participants are taking comfort from the favorable global cues however Nifty is still facing a hurdle around the short term moving average i.e. 20 DEMA. We reiterate our view to focus on stock selection and trade management until we get some clarity over the next directional move. Nifty witnessed two days of recovery following adojiformation on the daily chart, indicating a bullish reversal. Moreover, the Nifty has reclaimed the critical 55-day exponential moving average. However, Nifty needs to cross over 22,100 to witness a clear rally towards the all-time high of 22,525. The domestic market swiftly rebounded from an initial downturn and maintained a positive trajectory throughout the day, buoyed by favourable global cues driven by dovish comments from the BoE and buying activity at lower levels in the wake of a recent sell-off. Additionally, the retreat of crude oil prices from recent highs contributed to the positive sentiment. While most sectors experienced gains, the IT remained in the red due to subdued guidance from Accenture, a major global IT player. Markets displayed volatility but managed to end higher amid gains in realty, telecom and auto stocks whereas IT stocks faltered sharply after Accenture slashed its full-year revenue guidance which renewed concerns of the sector in an uncertain global environment. FIIs offloading shares of domestic equities coupled with a sharp fall in the currency level has been indicating that the road ahead for equity markets could be bumpy. The Nifty opened at a gap down today. However, it recovered and closed with gains. On the daily charts we can observe that the index is in the process of retracing the fall it has witnessed from 22526 – 21710. The key retracement levels are placed at 22118 – 22214. The dip found buying interest at 21900 – 21880 where the 20-hour moving average was placed. The retracement process is still not complete and hence the rally can continue. The daily and hourly momentum indicator is providing a divergent signal which can lead to consolidation. The range is likely to be 22200 – 21900. Stock specific action is likely to continue during this period. Bank Nifty also consolidated within a narrow range around the key daily moving averages. On the upside the key retracement level can continue till 47000 – 47200 over the next few trading sessions. The crucial support zone is placed at 46500 – 46400. Nifty witnessed two days of recovery following adojiformation on the daily chart, indicating a bullish reversal. Moreover, the Nifty has reclaimed the critical 55-day exponential moving average. However, Nifty needs to cross over 22,100 to witness a clear rally towards the all-time high of 22,525. The Bank Nifty index saw robust buying from lower levels but struggled to breach the resistance at 47,000. Immediate support lies at 46,600-46,500, and as long as the index holds above this level, the outlook remains bullish.

The rupee traded weak, dropping by more than 0.25 to below 83.37, as the dollar index rallied above 104.08. This added pressure on the rupee following a positive gap up opening witnessed yesterday at 83.05. The rupee has fallen sharply by more than 0.30rs from its high of 83.05 over the last two days.

"While the broader markets saw a sharp sell-off earlier this month, a partial recovery in the smallcap indices since March 13 has helped revive the sentiment for smaller stocks. The percentage of the Nifty Smallcap 100 index stocks trading above their 20-day simple moving averages (SMA) has jumped to over 33 percent from 2 percent on March 13, when the negative sentiment was at its peak. Source : web.strike.money At the beginning of the year, at least 90 percent of the Nifty Smallcap 100 index stocks were seen trading above their 20-day SMA. Up to 40 percent rise from March lows At least 53 smallcaps from the pack of 250 smallcap index constituents have gained more than 10 percent since March 13, and as many as 113 stocks have recovered more than 5 percent. Swan Energy has gained by 40 percent, GPPL is up by 25 percent, Apar Industries by 21 percent, Hindustan Copper by 21 percent and Jamna Auto by 21 percent since the panic sell-off in broader markets. The Nifty Smallcap 250 index itself has recovered by 6 percent from March lows. Earnings growth backs rally in smallcaps, midcaps The earnings growth in midcap and smallcap firms has been the key trigger for up to 61 percent rally in broader market indices over the past two years. The Nifty Smallcap 150 index PE has expanded by about 10 percent in this period on the back of a 53 percent growth in earnings. This shows that the valuations may have increased in some pockets of the broader market, but earnings growth has been supportive of the rally over a couple of years, according to Purvesh Shelatkar, head of institutional broking at Monarch Networth Capital. ""For the recovery to sustain its momentum, earnings growth will be key in coming quarters,"" he said. Earnings growth supported the rally in smallcap index In a recent report, UBS said that the earnings trend of Indian companies continues to be strong, but regulators’ concerns about froth in small and midcap stocks, speculation in options, and a rapid rise in retail credit may affect tailwinds. Given the concerns on valuations and observations by the market regulator, smallcaps and midcaps may not see the frenzy buying seen in 2022 and 2023, according to Darpan Patil, founder of Rupic Consultancy. Should you rush? Experts are quick to caution that looking at the indices may not be a smart way to seek opportuni.ties in the broader markets. ""When it comes to smallcaps and midcaps, I prefer to study individual stocks and take a bottom-up approach, rather than look at the indices for valuation. Also, it is advisable to take a minimum of three-five-year view while taking exposure to smallcaps and midcaps,” Kunal Pawaskar, principal officer and head of portfolio management services at Tata Asset Management, said.

"Considering the bullish crossover in momentum indicators (MACD - moving average convergence divergence) and RSI (relative strength index) on hourly charts and smart recovery from the day's low in the previous session with a Doji candlestick pattern formation after red candle on daily charts, the Nifty 50 may make an attempt to rebound with resistance at the 21,900-22,000 area in the coming session, while the support lies at 21,800, and then at 21,700, experts said. On March 20, the Nifty 50 recovered more than 100 points from the day's low and settled 22 points higher at 21,839 ahead of the meeting of the Federal Reserve which maintained Fed funds rate at 5.25-5.50 percent and continued to signal for three rate cuts this year. The BSE Sensex was up 90 points at 72,102, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices ended flat. Stocks that recorded better performance than the benchmarks and broader markets included Maruti Suzuki India, Praj Industries, and BSE.Maruti Suzuki Indiarallied 3 percent to end at record closing high of Rs 11,941 and formed a long, bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts after breaking the consolidation of last couple of weeks as well as seeing breakout of horizontal resistance trendline adjoining highs of February 23 and March 5, with healthy volumes, while trading above all key moving averages. Praj Industriesclimbed above all key moving averages in a single day and rallied 9.4 percent to Rs 518, forming robust bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with significantly higher volumes. In fact, it has seen a decisive breakout of long downward sloping resistance trendline, which is a positive sign. BSEclimbed 4 percent to Rs 2,033 and formed a bullish engulfing candlestick (trend reversal) pattern on the daily charts after downtrend, with above average volumes, though it traded below 21, 50 and 100-day EMAs (exponential moving averages). Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: Maruti Suzuki India In recent market movements, Maruti has shown a consolidation around the 21-day exponential moving average (DEMA) subsequent to reaching a Double Top formation near Rs 11,700 mark. However, in the most recent trading session, the stock exhibited a significant breakthrough above Rs 11,700 level, closing near Rs 11,940. This breakout is particularly notable as the daily stochastic oscillator has reversed direction from the 50 levels, indicating a potentially bullish momentum. Consequently, there appears to be an attractive opportunity at the current juncture. It is suggested that investors can consider initiating long positions within the range of Rs 11,850-Rs 12,000, with an upside target at Rs 12,500. To manage risk, a stop-loss order should be placed near Rs 11,625 on a daily closing basis.  BSE Following a peak near Rs 2,599 level, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) underwent a significant downturn, experiencing a sharp decline of 25 percent in its overall value. However, over the course of the week, BSE has managed to stabilize around Rs 2,000 level, forming a sustained support base. Notably, during this period, a bullish AB=CD pattern has emerged near Rs 2,000 level, providing further confirmation of positive market sentiment. Additionally, analysis of the 3-hour stochastic indicator reveals a bullish divergence, indicating a favourable outlook for the stock. Considering these factors alongside chart patterns, investors may find it prudent to consider initiating buy positions within the range of Rs 2,000-2,050, with an upside objective targeted at Rs 2,300. To manage risk, a stop-loss order should be set at Rs 1,890 on a daily closing basis, providing protection against potential downside movements. Praj Industries Since reaching a high of Rs 650 on November 30, 2023, Praj has undergone a notable decline, shedding nearly 31 percent in its price. Presently, the stock has demonstrated resilience by closing above the 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA) and finding support at this crucial technical level. Additionally, a significant development on the daily chart is the breach of the bear line, coinciding with the vicinity between 0.382-0.50 percent retracement level of its previous upward movement, indicating a potential reversal in the downtrend. Moreover, the daily stochastic indicator has exhibited bullish divergence, as indicated in the accompanying chart, further bolstering the bullish sentiment surrounding the stock. Given these technical signals, investors might consider initiating buy positions within the range of Rs 490-520, with an upside target set at Rs 600. To mitigate risk, a stop-loss order should be placed near Rs 460 on a daily closing basis, ensuring protection against adverse price movements.

"Leafing through top global developments, oil prices were on the boil, hovering at the highest level since October, followed by copper surging past $9,000 per tonne, and NATO planning relief aid for Ukraine. Here's what you should gather from World Street on its April 3 edition: Crude at 6-month high Oil prices surged to their highest point since October on April 2, driven by investor attention to emerging supply risks stemming from heightened tensions in the Middle East and a Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian oil facility.

Copper gathers shine Copper surged past the $9,000-per-tonne mark again as investors assessed positive factory data from China, its leading consumer, alongside the possibility of production reductions by top smelting companies in the country. Investor sentiment is bolstered by encouraging signs from the world's second-largest economy, highlighted by March's official manufacturing purchasing managers index hitting its highest level in a year.

"The pharmaceutical industry in India grew 6.8 percent and had a Rs 1.93 lakh crore turnover in calendar year 2023. This growth was fuelled by the fast growth of domestic branded pharmaceutical companies and a government scheme that promotes the sale of generic drugs. The Rs 10,000-crore generics market forms a small segment of the Indian pharmaceutical market. It is dominated by Cipla, Alkem, and the Jan Aushadhi scheme. The Jan Aushadhi scheme, a central government scheme, aims to provide quality medicines at affordable prices (at least 50 percent cheaper, and in some cases, up to 90 percent cheaper). What is the Jan Aushadhi scheme and why was it launched? The Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched by the Department of Pharmaceuticals to provide quality medicines at affordable prices to the masses through special kendras (Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana Kendras). The programme targets launching 20,000 new pharmacies in the upcoming fiscal year, Ravi Dadhich, chief executive officer, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Bureau of India (PMBI), the government arm that executes the scheme, had said in an earlier interview with News 18. Jan Aushadhi Kendras, which are run by private entrepreneurs with support from the government in the form of incentives, have been able to provide around 1,800 types of medicine and 300 types of surgical devices. Also read:Government issues code to check unethical drug promotion Who owns the Jan Aushadhi kendras and who supplies medicines? An individual, partnership, charitable society or a government agency submits an application to open a Jan Aushadhi Kendra. Medicines are procured through an open tender system from private manufacturers and public sector drug manufacturers. Each batch of procured drugs is tested at laboratories empanelled with the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) and then sent to the Jan Aushadhi Kendras. How has the scheme impacted the top line of domestic pharma companies? The number of Jan Aushadhi stores has increased approximately nine-fold in the last five years, with sales reaching Rs 850 crore as of December 2022 and coverage expanding 3.6 times to 1,759 drugs. “However, shortages of medicines and stock-keeping units (SKUs) persist,” said a recent report by HDFC Securities. In addition, expenditure allocation has seen a 1.6-fold increase, reaching Rs 280 crore for FY24-25, up from the revised allocation of Rs 11o crore in FY23-24, according to interim budget documents. “Patients and doctors often associate low-cost medicines with poor quality, creating a mental barrier that may delay the acceptance of generic medicines to some extent,” the HDFC Securities note adds. Kotak Securities notes that the expansion of Jan Aushadhi Kendras would hamper the growth of the branded generics market in India. “With Jan Aushadhi’s rapid expansion, there is a risk of this hit on IPM (Indian Pharmaceutical Market) swelling further. As seen earlier and more recently with NMC (National Medical Commission), the government is keen on pushing generics,” it said. The Indian Pharma Market grew in 2022 and 2024 because it was allowed to hike prices linked to WPI for the National List of Essential Medicines. On Mar 27, 2023, the NPPA announced the calculated annual change in WPI as 12.1 percent for CY22 over CY21. This translated to a significant price hike of ~12 percent (~10.8 percent in FY22) vs a normal hike of 2-3 percent for 800+ scheduled drugs and medical devices from 1 Apr 2023. Price benefits started reflecting in 9M’24 performances. However, for FY 25, in line with the wholesale price index (WPI), the government is set to allow only a .0055 percent increase in prices of drugs listed in the National List of Essential Medicines. The benefits enjoyed in the previous years will not continue in FY 25.

"The Schneider Electric Infrastructure stock has had an electrifying run of late, nearly doubling so far this year, and growing five-fold in the last 12 months, as investments pour into the power sector. The company has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government’s investment in the power sector, partly helped by its multinational lineage and products, which are used in data centres and production of semiconductors. On April 10,Schneider Electric Infrastructureclosed at Rs 781, up 93 percent in the year so far. Its products in the power segment include transformers and switchgears. The company's diversified products in systems, services and transactional segments also contributed to its growth. Riding the power wave “India’s power demand is expected to double by 2045 and it is aiming for an ambitious 500 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. Capital expenditure for FY 2024-25 is estimated at Rs 11 trillion, and we see a large part of it flowing into the energy sector,” said Hemal Shah, Fund Manager of Torus ORO PMS. This can lead to huge demand in this sector in the form of grids, insulators, switchgears, transmission, smart meters, wires and cables. Schneider Electric Infra’s order book expanded 38.8 percent on-year to Rs 1,358.6 crore in the fiscal third quarter. The growth in the order book was driven by the power and grid segment, mobility and other electrosensitive segments, CFO Suparna Bhattacharyya said in a conference call in February. The order books of the company's peers CG Power and Industrial Solutions and Voltamp, grew by 34 percent while Transformers and Rectifiers India's book expanded by 71 percent in the quarter. Schneider Electric's  Q3 revenue rose 29.5 percent on-year to Rs 743.9 crore, with nearly half coming from the Power and Grid segment. Net profit more than doubled from a year ago to Rs 91 crore. Schneider's revenue and profit growth in the past year has far outpaced its competitors (except Transformers and Rectifiers, whose Q3 net profit zoomed quarter-on-quarter on a low base). Revenue comparision The company's earnings have also helped the stock beat analyst target prices. In February 2024, when it was trading at Rs 590, LKP Securities had set a target price of Rs 690 for the stock. It has already gone past that. Profit comparision New management and diversified business portfolio Elara Capital said the company’s new management, represented by MD and CEO Udai Singh, who took on the role in September 2023, has continued the growth strategy with stable margins. The firm has pivoted from taking orders on an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) basis to “a transactional mode (product via distribution),” Elara said. Schneider has moved from a production and construction (EPC) model to a product-supplier model (selling products through distributors), where the risk on receivables is lower, along with better cash flow. The strategy has increased the company’s gross margins from 30 percent in Q3FY23 to 36 percent in Q3FY24. Transactional revenue for the company also increased 60 percent on-year to Rs 160 crore in Q3. “Schneider Electric Infrastructure has consistently performed in terms of earnings in the last nine quarters. It has been diversifying its portfolio. It has been able to get repeat customers across its various product portfolios,” said Avinash Pathak, Research Analyst at LKP Securities. The company is also providing digital services. Should investors buy the Schneider Electric Infrastructure stock? After the huge rally, experts recommend it is better to wait and watch the stock and add it during dips. “Schneider’s valuations look stretched. The stock has fully priced in most of the positives. Investors should not rush to buy this stock now,” said Kranthi Bathini, Director of Equity strategies at WealthMill Securities. Shailesh Saraf, Managing director of Dynamic Equities, also said the stock was trading at expensive valuations of 90 trailing PE , but added that this is justified due to the company’s strong earnings growth. “When the profit growth is above 100 percent, it is justified. It is a good stock in a sector that has huge demand for its products,” said Saraf.

"Broader indices recovered some of the previous week's losses and outperformed the main indices in the week ended March 22. Global cues, including a rate hike from the Bank of Japan, interest rate unchanged by the Bank of England, Fed assured about rate cuts this year, and solid direct tax collection kept the market volatile. This week, BSE Sensex added 188.51 or 0.25 percent to close at 72,831.94 and the Nifty50 index rose 73.45 points or 0.33 percent to end at 22,096.80. Among sectors, the Nifty Realty index rose 5.4 percent, the Nifty Auto and Metal indices added 4 percent each, while the Nifty Information Technology index lost 6 percent. Among broader indices, the BSE Small-cap, Mid-cap, and Large-cap indices rose 1.8 percent, 1.4 percent, and 0.6 percent, respectively. During the week, Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) increased their selling as they sold equities worth Rs 8,365.53 crore, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought equities worth Rs 19,351.62 crore. ""Amidst mixed signals from global peers, investor sentiment remained volatile, influenced by uncertainties surrounding pivotal policy decisions from major central banks. The unexpected interest rate hike by the BoJ after 17 years and the ECB's choice to maintain rates contributed to subdued market sentiment. However, the market rebounded following the Fed's indication to proceed with three interest rate cuts this year, despite inflation remaining above the long-term target,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. ""Mid & Smallcap could recover halve as buying improved led by continued DIIs & FIIs inflows. The IT sector faced headwinds driven by the global slowdown in spending. Investors redirected attention towards the realty sector, which emerged as the top performer of the week."" ""The bounce is expected to continue in the short-term as traders punt to buy when the market is trading at oversold territory. However, concerns persisted regarding inflated valuations in mid and small-cap stocks. And large caps are expected to outperform in the medium term,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index added nearly 2 percent with Manoj Vaibhav Gems N Jewellers, eMudhra, Vadilal Industries, Dhani Services, Gensol Engineering, Reliance Power, Sobha, The Anup Engineering, Reliance Infrastructure, Swan Energy, Praj Industries, Skipper, Jayaswal Neco Industries and Five-Star Business Finance added between 15-42 percent.  On the other hand, Tata Investment Corporation, M K Proteins, Jai Balaji Industries, PC Jeweller, Sanmit Infra, Gujarat Ambuja Exports and DB Realty lost 10-20 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities On Friday, Nifty witnessed two days of recovery following a doji formation on the daily chart, indicating a bullish reversal. Moreover, the Nifty has reclaimed the critical 55-day exponential moving average. However, Nifty needs to cross over 22,100 to witness a clear rally towards the all-time high of 22,525. Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas On the daily charts, we can observe that the index is in the process of retracing the fall it has witnessed from 22526 – 21710. The key retracement levels are placed at 22118 – 22214. The dip found buying interest at 21900 – 21880 where the 20-hour moving average was placed. The retracement process is still not complete and hence the rally can continue. The daily and hourly momentum indicators provide a divergent signal which can lead to consolidation. The range is likely to be 22,200–21,900. Stock-specific action is likely to continue during this period. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Next week being a truncated week and the derivatives' monthly expiry, we might see some volatility while Nifty is likely to consolidate at higher levels. Also, US GDP data, and other key economic data would keep investors busy.

"The BSE Capital Goods index climbed unprecedented heights, outstripping the Sensex by a significant margin, in FY24. With an impressive 80 percent surge over the past year, the index has eclipsed the benchmark's 25 percent gain, marking the highest level of outperformance in 18 years. Keeping up a trend, the capital goods index recorded the longest streak of outperformance in FY24, when it raced ahead of the Sensex for the fourth consecutive year. Yet, in terms of actual rate of outperformance, last fiscal ranks second only to FY06, when the BSE Capital Goods index delivered an outperformance of 82 percent, clocking an annual return of 156 percent, higher than 74 percent for the BSE bellwether.  On April 2, the Capital Goods index hit a new all-time high of 62,370, with a gain of 0.65 percent. Heavyweight stocks like L&T played a pivotal role in driving this surge. Other prominent players in the league included BEL, Laxmi Machine Works, Carborandum Universal, Hindustan Aeronautics, Thermax, ABB India, and Siemens India. All of these scaled their fresh life highs on the day. Also read:Debt-free capital goods MNCs outperform Nifty on capex boosters Analysts attribute this remarkable performance to a confluence of factors. “The capital goods sector is firing on all cylinders,” Purvesh Shelatkar, head of institutional broking at Monarch Networth Capital, said. ""While government support, coupled with a resurgence in private capital expenditure, has laid a strong foundation for growth, improvements in capacity utilisation among manufacturing companies, and margin expansions across the capital goods segment, have propelled the profitability."" This dynamics is evident in the numbers. Earnings growth of the capital goods sector has outpaced that of the broader market. BSE-listed capital goods companies recorded a staggering 38 percent growth in earnings, far surpassing the 18 percent growth by Sensex companies in the past fiscal. Expectations of continued surge in earnings has led to a notable expansion in the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the BSE Capital Goods index, reflecting a rerating of stocks driven by solid fundamentals. The index is trading at a trailing P/E of 41x compared with Sensex’s 24x.  While healthy order books provide revenue visibility, enhanced supply chain efficiencies and robust balance sheets further bolster the sector's resilience, analysts said. However, there is a chance that stock prices may take a breather. “There could be some consolidation in stock prices in the first half of FY25 because of general elections. Otherwise, the demand side scenario remains robust and we should see the trend continuing,” Hemil Shah, Fund Manager, Torus ORO PMS, said. Shah believes capex will be good in coming year keeping stock on high growth trajectory. This view is echoed by other analysts who believe despite steep valuations, stocks may have more steam left in the medium-term. Avinash Kumar of LKP Securities highlighted the sector's immense growth potential, driven by a sizable total addressable market (TAM) and the prospect of improved export markets as factors that support high valuations beyond the near-terms earnings numbers. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have also shown confidence in industrials, adding buoyancy to stocks, he said. Shelatkar is particularly bullish on debt-free MNC capital goods companies like ABB, Siemens and Cummins which should ride the cyclical upturn and seem poised to deliver higher double digit, superior to that of Nifty companies.

"Bank of America Securities (BoFA) sees a favourable risk reward scenario developing for Divi's Laboratories as the stock trades at a reasonable valuation in comparison to other largecap peers. The stock took beating in the past year, sharply underperforming other pharma stocks on the back of its two-year earnings downgrade cycle and margin decline to below pre-COVID levels. The stock has corrected 8 percent this year against a 12 percent jump in the BSE healthcare index. According to BoFA Securities, the correction in the counter not only factors in the company's weak margin performance but also stacks its risk reward better than other largecap players. BoFA has upgraded the stock to a “buy” from “underperform” and also raised the price target by 19 percent to Rs 4,025 a share. Buoyed by the ratings upgrade, ,Divi's Laboratoriessettled nearly 2 percent higher on the NSE on April 3. ""Likely bottoming of margin in near term and relative valuation provide an attractive entry point for Divi's Laboratories,"" BoFA said. ""We also see lower risk to the 35 percent earnings growth over FY25-26 with valuation for Divis at 35.5x FY26 P/E appearing more compelling as compared to large peers given uncertainty on US generic pricing, regulatory risks."" The end of destocking cycle and peer commentary suggests bottoming-out of margins in the near term, it said. BoFA expects margins to reach 33 percent by FY26, driven by factors such as the successful launch of generic active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and contributions from new drug master files (DMFs). Analysts also expect increased supplies of contrast media APIs and Good Laboratory Practice-1 intermediate supplies to play a role, along with the ramp-up of Kakinada post-commissioning. These improvements are projected to start contributing from the second half of FY25, leading to a 35 percent earnings CAGR with the full impact likely visible in FY26.

US Federal Reserve’s chairman Jerome Powell addressed a gathering at Stanford’s 2024 Business, Government and Society forum on Wednesday. Bloomberg quoted him stating that ‘policymakers will wait for clearer signs of lower inflation before cutting interest rates, even though a recent bump in prices didn't alter their broader trajectory’. Earlier during the week, the stronger-than-expected PMI data had pulled the markets into red and the bond markets had surged. This had resulted in a weak investor sentiment, as worries of Federal Reserve’s rate cuts not coming in soon, troubled traders.

"According to Raghvendra Nath, the MD of Ladderup Wealth Management, PSU stocks have reached the overvalued territory, and it's only a matter of time before the bubble bursts. In an interview with Moneycontrol, he suggested exiting the segment due to the high allocation towards the PSE sector. Considering the high allocation towards PSE sector, he believes exiting the segment would make sense. Due to the rally in the recent past one year, ""we may experience market consolidation or sideways movement in the near term. But the fundamentally strong companies will bounce back from the corrections relatively unscathed,"" says Raghvendra Nath, who has more than 29 years of corporate experience. Do you think investors should book profits in PSU space after recent run up? The PSU stocks have seen an impeccable rally in the past 1 year with the PSE Index (public sector enterprise) rising over 100 percent in the same period. This rally was fuelled by the increasing order book in sectors such as railways and energy while the surge in PSU banks was seen due to an improvement in the balance sheet and healthy loan growth. These improvements in the PSE sector coupled with the low float of these companies has caused a euphoria making the stocks runway ahead from their fundamentals. However, continuing the same growth momentum would be a hurdle for these stocks as they have a knack for slow execution and poor governance. Historically, post elections we have also seen a slowdown in the order book which would cause more problems for the PSE segment. Coming onto the valuation point of view, the historical PE ratios of railway stocks has been in the range of 10-15 times while currently they are trading at a PE of 30-40 times, PSU banks which used to trade around a P/B ratio of 1 to 1.5 times have almost doubled to trade at a P/B ratio of 2-3 times. Energy & railway stocks have also seen their PE ratios increase by 20 percent-30 percent from their historical levels. Clearly these stocks have entered into the overvalued territory and it’s just a matter of time before the bubble would burst. Also read:Small, midcaps to outperform largecaps this year as economy pivots to manufacturing: Emkay The recent plummet in the markets saw the PSE index fall 10 percent in 5 days, showing signs of concerns in this segment. Considering the high allocation towards this sector, we believe exiting the segment would make sense as they have clearly forayed into a territory of extreme overvaluation. Is it the good time to bottom fish in the midcap IT space and stay with the same segment instead of largecap IT space? On macro level, largecaps are trading at relatively attractive valuation as compared to midcap IT space. But the IT companies in general have shown good returns in past 6 months. There are some opportunities in the space, but selective stock-picking will be preferred over betting on the sector. Do you surprise if the market sees sharp correction in coming weeks despite more tailwinds than less headwinds? We have seen some correction in past weeks in small and mid-cap index, and the space is likely to experience headwinds in coming days. This is again due to the caution from SEBI, and froth building up in the market. Due to the rally in the recent past one year, we may experience market consolidation or sideways movement in the near term. But the fundamentally strong companies will bounce back from the corrections relatively unscathed. Do you think the stress tests in AMC is one of key reasons for nervousness in the equity markets? We do see it being a key reason for the recent corrections in the markets along with other factors like tax loss harvesting, profit bookings and some caution due to the high valuations in the market. Specially with markets at such high valuations, the bourses are expected to be under stress. Also read:Mind the gap: the main lesson from MF stress tests But as we highlighted, the companies showing good numbers are likely to bounce back from such corrections in coming weeks. Do you still expect significant correction in SME and microcap stocks? We do see corrections happening in the SME and micro stocks, due to liquidity being sucked out on account of Mahadev betting app scam along with the ED being quite active in the space, which might shy some investors away. Certain rallies based on hearsay and market momentum are also to contribute to high valuations, and corrections in such stocks are imminent.

"Volatile trade ruled the market through the week ended March 22 with a slight positive note of 0.3 percent rise in Nifty at the time of settling down a tad below 22,100 levels. There has been a strong show of tug-of-war between the counterparties to exhibit their presence, though no conducive settlement was seen, portraying tentativeness in the market. The Nifty still hovers within the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving average (DEMA) on the daily chart, indicating uncertainty. However, the recent low signifies a lower low formation on the daily timeframe, and a further correction below the same could indicate the inception of a bearish trend in the markets. For now, 21,900-21,850 is likely to cushion any short-term blip, with major focus on a swing low of 21,700, breaching which disruption on chart structure could be seen in the current truncated week. On the higher end, 22,200-22,250 is expected to act as an intermediate hurdle, and an authoritative closure above the same could only bring some mojo back into the market. As we head for a truncated week with just three trading sessions and monthly expiry, it would be crucial to track global developments to have an immediate effect on the markets. Also, a spike in volatility is anticipated, keeping expiry in view. Hence, it is advisable to maintain caution and stay fussy with stock selection for an outperformance in the market. Here are three buy calls for the short term: Apollo Hospitals Enterprise: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,375.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,100 | Target: Rs 6,650-6,770 | Return: 6 percent Apollo Hospitals has witnessed a decent correction of over 13 percent in the recent period from the lifetime high zone, retracting towards the neckline of the breakout on the weekly time frame. After a couple of weeks of consolidation, the stock has regained strength and reverted towards the primary trend on the back of notable volumes, indicating an opportunity to go long. The technical indicators are very much in line with the bullish development, adding a strong undertone to the counter. Hence, we recommend buying Apollo Hospitals around Rs 6,370-6,350, with a stop-loss of Rs 6,100 and target of Rs 6,650-6,770. Eicher Motors: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,988.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,800 | Target: Rs 4,180-4,200 | Return: 5 percent Eicher Motors witnessed a strong spurt in price-volume in the last trading week from the cluster of its significant EMAs and made a strong runaway gap. Also, on the daily time frame, the counter has witnessed a sloping trendline breakout and made a strong weekly closure above its immediate swing high. From a technical standpoint, the 14-period RSI (relative strength index) and MACD (moving average convergence divergence) both signal a positive crossover, suggesting the counter looks poised to reclaim its lifetime high zone in a comparable period. Hence, we recommend buying Eicher Motors around Rs 3,970-3,950, with a stop-loss of Rs 3,800 and target of Rs 4,180-4,200.

"The week ended March 15 proved to be challenging for bullish investors as the broader markets experienced their most significant decline in recent memory. While the Nifty 50 index saw a modest loss of nearly 2 percent over the week, the Nifty Smallcap 250 index faced a substantial correction of 6 percent, and the Nifty Midcap 150 index declined by over 4 percent. Despite this market turmoil, some relief emerged as the Nifty 50 managed to close above the crucial 22,000 mark. Earlier discussions centred around the 22,500 mark, representing the 100 percent extension of a previous move. As anticipated, a corrective move ensued from that level, leading to a trendline breakdown in the Nifty 50. However, this breakdown would only be invalidated if the index closes above 22,200. On the downside, 21,850 stands as a crucial support level, and breaching it might push the index towards the 21,600 level. Turning to the Nifty Smallcap 250 index, it has already corrected over 50 percent of the rally that commenced in October 2023. Additionally, a bullish harmonic pattern resulted in a sharp bounce during Thursday's trading session. Meanwhile, the Nifty Midcap 150 index retested its 100-day exponential moving average (DEMA) before witnessing a notable rebound. Looking ahead, while there might be another shake-off in the market in the near term, investors could view this as an opportunity to initiate fresh long positions. It is anticipated that the market uncertainty will likely dissipate by the end of the month, allowing the markets to resume their primary upward trend. On a different note, the Nifty Bank corrected approximately 3 percent during the last week, closing near the 46,500 mark. Currently, it rests on falling trendline support, which would be breached below the 46,000 level. Thus, for the upcoming week, 46,000 remains a critical support level for the index. A sustained hold above this level could pave the way for a recovery, with a move beyond 47,000 potentially reigniting bullish momentum. Here are three buy calls for next 3-4 weeks: ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 419 | Stop-Loss: Rs 390 | Target: Rs 475 | Return: 13 percent After reaching a peak near Rs 475 mark on January 4, 2024, ITC has experienced a significant decline of 16 percent. However, in the subsequent 18 trading sessions, ITC has shown stability by avoiding further declines and has instead consolidated within a range of Rs 400-416. Notably, in the previous trading session, there was notable buying interest observed at lower levels, accompanied by substantial trading volume. From a technical standpoint, the formation of a bullish AB=CD pattern on the daily chart of ITC within the mentioned price zone of Rs 400-416. Interestingly, this zone also coincides with the 0.382 percent retracement level of a price swing that occurred between January 2023 and July 2023, as indicated on the chart. Additionally, it has formed complex structure forming on the daily RSI indicator, resembling a 'W shape' below the 30 level, which suggests a potentially lucrative buying opportunity. Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 415-425 with an upside target of Rs 475 and a stop-loss would be placed near Rs 390 on a daily close basis.  Britannia Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,974 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,790 | Target: Rs 5,250 | Return: 5.5 percent Following a peak near Rs 5,386 level, Britannia experienced a significant decline of almost 11 percent in its value. However, over the past couple of months, Britannia has stabilized around Rs 4,800 levels, forming a prolonged support base. Notably, this level coincides with the 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA) and represents a 50 percent retracement of its previous upward movement from November 2023 to December 2023, as depicted in the provided chart. Additionally, a bullish AB=CD pattern has emerged near Rs 4,800 level, further confirming positive market sentiment. Furthermore, the daily stochastic indicator indicates a bullish divergence, suggesting a favourable outlook for the Therefore, investors may consider initiating buy positions within the range of Rs 4,950-4,980, targeting an upside objective of Rs 5,250, with a stop-loss set at Rs 4,790 on a daily closing basis.  Aegis Logistics: Buy | LTP: Rs 381 | Stop-Loss: Rs 355 | Target: Rs 430 | Return: 13 percent On March 7, 2024, Aegis Logistics reached a high of Rs 455. Since then, it has experienced a significant decline of 21.5 percent in its price. Presently, the stock has found support at the 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA).

Gainers included Tata Consumers Products, M&M, BPCL, Bajaj Auto and Adani Ports... Read More The Nifty opened on a flat note and consolidated for the day. It closed marginally in the red down ~9 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty is in the process of cooling off after the sharp run-up in the previous couple of trading sessions. The zone of 22400 – 22350 is the crucial support zone and dips towards these zones should be used as a buying opportunity. The hourly momentum indicator has a negative crossover which is a sell signal and also suggests that there could be some more consolidation before the uptrend resumes. Overall, this dip should be used a buying opportunity. Bank Nifty is also consolidating after breaking out of the range on the upside. It is likely to resume its up-move towards 47850 – 48000 from a short-term perspective. So the minor degree pullbacks should be used as a buying opportunity. The Bank Nifty index maintained a narrow consolidation pattern in anticipation of the RBI policy. With downside support at 47000 and upside resistance at 48000, a breakout in either direction could trigger significant market moves. Despite the consolidation, the overall sentiment remains bullish, suggesting that dips should be seen as buying opportunities, especially with immediate support around the 47400-47350 zone. The domestic market took a breather today after achieving a fresh record high yesterday. Factors such as a rising dollar, increasing US bond yields, and a notable uptick in crude oil prices collectively dampened investor sentiment. Moreover, better-than-expected US manufacturing data raised worries about a potential delay in interest rate cuts.

Investors are eagerly anticipating guidance from the upcoming RBI monetary policy announcement for insight into near-term market direction. Markets witnessed select profit taking in banking and IT stocks as caution prevailed throughout the session ahead of the RBI monetary policy decision on Friday. Rising US bond yields have led to FIIs fleeing Indian equities in recent sessions. However, we are seeing renewed optimism in the broader market in the mid & small cap stocks after the sharp correction over past few months. There is lot of money waiting on the sidelines to be invested in medium enterprises amid easing valuations and hopes of strong economic growth going ahead.

"Higher-than-expected US retail inflation for March has delayed expectations of the Fed interest rate cuts to beyond June, sending equity markets in a tailspin, and bond yields soaring. A rate cut in June now looks unlikely, said experts. TheUS consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4 percent month-on-month in March, maintaining the same pace as in February. On an year-on-year basis, March CPI inflation was at 3.5 percent, accelerating from 3.2 percent year-on-year in February. Both month-on-month and year-on-year readings beat Reuters poll estimates. Further, core inflation too remained hot, coming in at 0.4 percent month-on-month, and at 3.8 percent year-on-year. Stocks fell. S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average --all tumbled about 1 percent or more. Gift Nifty on IFSC fell 0.6 percent, or 130 points to 22,629 at 8.40 pm IST, after the NSE Nifty 50 made a record high in intraday trading earlier. Is the US Fed rate cut completely off the table for now? ""This is the 3rd successive 'hot' CPI print, and has completely shaken expectations of both the extent and the timing of rate cuts in 2024. We continue to maintain that the Fed will not cut rates this year, on the back of hotter inflation and slowing-yet-stable growth,"" said Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services. The inflation reading may have also reduced the expectations of the number of rate cuts. “With this, the probability of a June cut (<20 percent) is minimal. Even July rate cut probability (45 percent) is less than even, with the first cut expectation being pushed to September meeting. This also means that the market now expects 2 cuts by year end instead of 3, said Pranab Uniyal, head of products at HDFC Securities. Other experts also echoed similar views, saying the rate cut may get pushed beyond June. ""The data does not completely remove the possibility of Fed action this year, but it certainly lessens the chances the Fed is cutting the overnight rate in the next couple months,"" said Phillip Neuhart, director of market and economic research at First Citizens, according to Reuters. ""There is a high-risk cutting rates in June gets pushed out further. The probability is likely going to move lower after today's print, meaning that a June cut is less likely,"" said Ben Vaske, senior investment strategist at Orion, in a Reuters report. Will US CPI halt Indian stock markets rally? The impact may be felt strongly on the Indian markets, which may see a short-term correction, said experts. “There is exuberance across the equity markets and commodities. They are all over stretched and just need a trigger to start correcting. Gold and silver prices, which are up almost 20 percent in last 6-7 weeks also need to correct. This hotter-than-expected inflation data would also cause a trigger for US and Indian markets to correct. US Fed might keep the interest rate unchanged for longer due to the data point,” said Amit Goel, co-founder and chief global strategist at Pace 360. However, Ashish Goel of Investsavy PMS said the market may have only a knee-jerk reaction to the US CPI data, rather than a prolonged period of pain.

"Private consumption could see a boost with a pick-up in rural activity and steady urban demand, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said as part of his Monetary Policy announcement on April 5. Das noted that private consumption is likely to gather steam, driven by heightened rural activity and consistent urban demand. “Urban households are projected to increase discretionary spending, as indicated by the Reserve Bank's consumer survey, alongside improving income levels, fostering a positive outlook for private consumption,” he said. He noted that inflation has come down significantly even though it remains above the 4 percent target. He said that efforts are underway to ensure the comprehensive transmission of policy measures and to anchor household inflation expectations. Going forward, the outlook for agriculture and rural activity appears bright, with good rabi wheat crop and improved prospects of kharif crops, due to expected normal south-west monsoon, Das said. Strengthening of rural demand, improving employment conditions and informal sector activity, moderating inflationary pressures and sustained momentum in manufacturing and services sector should boost private consumption, as per the RBI governor. “According to Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), the unemployment rate fell to its lowest in the series at 3.1 percent (usual status) in calendar year 2023. Similarly, labour force sustained momentum in manufacturing and services sector should boost private consumption,” Das said. He added that as per the RBI survey, consumer confidence one year ahead reached a new high. Normalcy in monsoon could boost farm output An anticipated bumper rabi wheat harvest in the 2023-24 season is poised to mitigate cereal prices. Favourable early signs of a normal monsoon bode well for the upcoming kharif season, he said. With the anticipated normalcy in the upcoming southwest monsoon is expected to boost agricultural operations, rural activity is anticipated to amplify, complemented by steadfast urban demand, Das said. “The envisaged rise in discretionary spending among urban households, supported by the Reserve Bank's consumer survey, alongside improving income levels, underscores a favourable landscape for bolstering private consumption. Assuming a normal monsoon, CPI inflation for 2024-25 is projected at 4.5 per cent,” the governor said. “The escalating frequency of climate-related disruptions poses an inherent risk to food prices. Concerns loom over low reservoir levels, particularly in southern regions, coupled with projections of above-normal temperatures during April-June. The tight supply-demand dynamics in certain pulses and the pricing dynamics of essential vegetables warrant close monitoring,” said Das.
","The RBI Governor, Shaktikanta Das, predicts a boost in private consumption due to heightened rural activity and consistent urban demand. He expects a pick-up in discretionary spending, driven by increased income levels and positive consumer surveys. Despite the current high inflation rate, Das emphasizes the efforts being made to ensure the comprehensive transmission of policy measures to stabilize household inflation expectations.The agricultural sector is expected to be bright with good rabi wheat crop and improved prospects of kharif crops due to the expected normal monsoon. Strong rural demand, improved employment conditions, and sustained momentum in manufacturing and services sectors are projected to contribute to this rise in private consumption.The RBI governor also highlights that consumer confidence has reached a new high, supported by the Reserve Bank's consumer survey, which suggests a favorable landscape for bolstering private consumption."

"The metal segment has made a sharp recovery backed by strong volumes, with Nifty metal trading at around 7,900 from the lows of Rs 7,600 on March 14. Though the index was trading lower from the previous day on wide-spread selling on March 19, analyst said metal stocks have found support near their critical levels amid selling pressure. In the short term, short covering may lead to a rebound in the sector, analysts said. On March 18, Nifty Metal gained significant momentum, rising 2.5 percent in a day, with a sharp recovery in Tata Steel, Vedanta, Jindal Steel and Power, and Steel Authority of India. A long build-up was seen in Tata Steel, with prices scaling significant highs and a robust addition in Open Interest (OI).

Jindal Steel and Poweradded close to 3 percent in OI with sustained positivity. The price action implies that the immediate level of 825 will be met.

WhileSteel Authority of Indiais hovering around its 50-Simple Moving Average (SMA) placed at 125, the reversal may signal a fresh uptrend for the next session.

While insider selling could be for a variety of reasons, promoter buying is a good enough sign that the stock may be undervalued. Proof of that is the fact that the promoters are willing to shell out money to back their view. At the same time, it is not a given that promoter buying always signals undervaluation. The quantum of purchases should give an idea. If the promoter is willing to invest a meaningful amount, it means the shares are undervalued.

"As Indian markets hit fresh record highs in 2024, with the Sensex blazing past 75,000 and the Nifty moving towards 22,800, they are turning up the heat on global markets, outpacing several emerging and even developed markets. Over the past year alone, Nifty has soared 27 percent, eclipsing the modest 7 percent rise seen in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, which was dragged by Chinese heavyweights like Alibaba and Tencent. Over longer time periods though, Sensex and Nifty have delivered returns in line with global counterparts such as the US, China, Japan and Korea. Over the past 10 years, Sensex and Nifty delivered dollar returns of 109 percent and 110 percent, respectively. India's outperformance is attributed to what analysts call the Goldilocks moment, owing to favourable macroeconomic conditions, robust corporate earnings, stabilised interest rates, manageable inflation, and consistent policy momentum. Factors such as digitisation, expanding manufacturing capabilities, and a burgeoning housing sector, all buoyed by regulatory reforms and a growing middle class have also pushed the markets higher. Despite global economic uncertainties and inflation concerns, India's resilience shines through, capturing the attention of investors worldwide.  It’s not just the domestic growth pull that is leading global investors to flock to Indian markets. India's allure has been gaining momentum as global investors seek substitutes for sickly Chinese markets and as expectations grow that national elections this year will see Prime Minister Narendra Modi return for a rare third term, assuring investors of both political and policy continuity. Besides, Indian investors are also hooked to the stock markets putting money into Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) of mutual funds that give them the heft to support markets during dips. India versus the big EMs The meltdown in China's real estate industry caused a rout in equities pulling the Shanghai index down 13 percent in the last one year. The gap in weightage between the Indian and Chinese equities on the MSCI index has been narrowing with many global giants picking up shares on Dalal Street over those in Shanghai. Earlier this year, India surpassed Taiwan in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, securing the second position after China and affirming its status as an attractive investment option in emerging markets. Also Read |Market valuations may be stretched but there are pockets of value, say experts India’s share in the MSCI Emerging Markets index saw a significant jump over the last eight years, rising to 17.2 percent and is projected to rise further to 20 percent this year, according to Nuvama Institutional Equities. The relentless rally in Indian stocks has coincided with a historic downturn in Hong Kong, home to some of China’s most influential and innovative firms. The stringent Covid-related curbs, regulatory crackdowns on corporations, a property-sector crisis and geopolitical tensions with the West combined to erode China’s appeal as the world’s growth engine, and triggering an equities rout with the Hang Seng index tanking 16 percent in the last one year. Moreover, new listings have dried up in Hong Kong, leading to the Asian financial hub losing its position as one of the world’s busiest platforms for initial public offerings. On the flip side, India has seen a boom in IPOs, some of which were subscribed 60 times or even 100 times. Japan's Nikkei 225 this year smashed the 40,000 mark for the first time, continuing its comeback after decades of stagnation. However, the index has fallen 1 percent in the last one year, underperforming India Nifty as the Asian peer dealt with a shrinking population and rigid labour force, weighing on growth. Japan's economy officially entered recession earlier this year, giving up its spot as the world’s third-largest economy to Germany. The flows out of Japan also helped push Indian equities higher. India versus the US Despite higher bond yields, red hot inflation and constant recession threat, Wall Street's flagship index S&P 500 managed to keep up with India's Nifty, rising 27 percent in the last one year. Nifty outperformed Dow Jones by a margin. However, tech-heavy Nasdaq outpaced with returns of 34 percent during this period. While the US indices have managed to keep up with the buoyant Indian indices, a stronger-than-expected CPI inflation reading, at both the headline and the core level or a delay in interest rate cuts by the Fed could end up triggering a correction, according to analysts. India's outperformance to continue? Several market experts assert that the ongoing bull run in India is unparalleled in terms of wealth generation, which is reflected in the high market capitalisation of companies. The nation's mini-Goldilocks moment is being supported by healthy flows, and it now boasts a unique combination of size and growth, according to Motilal Oswal. Veteran investor Mark Mobius believes that China's market slowdown will only help India with more foreign investments. And investors seem happy to overlook risks, such as the already lofty valuations and any political surprises. Also Read |Sensex @75K: Four risks investors should not rule out International brokerage Haitong remains convinced of the strength in Indian markets in the long term, and expects to see a strong pickup post-elections. ""We would recommend looking at any dips as buying opportunities, as valuations are currently at all-time highs,"" it said. Even as growth remains stock and sentiment overwhelmingly positive, experts advise caution in pockets where valuations may be totally out of whack with reality.
","Positive Performance of Indian Stock Markets: The Sensex has soared past 75,000, while the Nifty has reached nearly 22,800, outpacing several emerging and developed markets. India's outperformance is attributed to favorable economic conditions, robust corporate earnings, stable interest rates, manageable inflation, and consistent policy momentum. The recent slump in Chinese equities has eroded China's appeal as the world's growth engine, triggering an equities rout with the Hang Seng index tanking 16 percent in the last one year.Comparison to Global Indices: India's stock market performance has been comparable to that of global counterparts such as the US, China, Japan, and Korea over the past 10 years. Indian investors are also hooked to the stock markets putting money into Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) of mutual funds, providing them with the heft to support markets during dips.Performance Compared to Other Emerging Markets: India's stock market outperformed the MSCI Emerging Markets index, which was dragged by Chinese heavyweights like Alibaba and Tencent. The recent boom in Indian stocks has coincided with a historic downturn in Hong Kong, which has eroded China's appeal as the world's growth engine.Challenges to India's Stock Market Performance: Despite its positive performance, India's stock market faces challenges, such as high valuations and concerns about global economic uncertainties and inflation concerns.

"Geojit's report on Daily Agri Picks Private weather forecaster Skymet on Tuesday projected southwest monsoon rainfall to be normal during the Jun-Sep season. India is likely to see rainfall to the tune of 102% of the long period average during the period, with an error margin of plus or minus 5%, it said in a report released today. However, the agency predicted a weak start tomonsoon this year due to El Nino effect, adding that these conditions may swiftly change into La Nina. The long period average for rainfall during the JunSep monsoon season is set at 868.8 mm for the country, according to the private weather forecaster. ""The spread of normal is 96-104% of LPA (long period average),"" it added. ""El Nino is swiftly flipping over to La Nina. And, the monsoon circulation inclines to be stronger during La Nina years,"" Jatin Singh, managing director at Skymet, said in the report. ""Also, the transition from Super El Nino to strong La Nina has historically tended to produce a decent monsoon."" However, Singh said the start of monsoon this year may not be as good due to the remnant effects of El Nino over the country. ""The second half of the season will have an overwhelming edge over the primal phase (in terms of rainfall),"" he added. ElNino, an abnormal warming of surface ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific, is usually associated with lower rainfall in India, while La Nina brings more moisture and precipitation across the country. Earlier this month, the India Meteorological Departmenthad forecast a hotter-than-usual summer during Apr-Jun, and said the El Nino weather phenomenon is likely to weaken and transition into La Nina conditions during the second half of the monsoon season. The government's weather bureau is yet to announce the date for its first forecast on the upcoming monsoon season. Rainfall distribution was eschewed during last year's monsoon due to formation of El Nino, with many regions receiving erratic rains. Hopes for a better spatial distribution of monsoon rainfall this year comes with the country facing a shortage in water levels in key reservoirs.

The correction in the domestic market has also been triggered by concerns over premium valuations and the delay of rate cuts by the US Fed due to hotter than expected inflation, which is evident from the upward trend in the dollar index. Investors are exercising caution as they await the upcoming US Fed meeting, seeking indications on the potential timing of a reversal in the rate cycle. Additionally, the gradual increase in crude oil prices is further dampening market sentiment. The Nifty has broken down from the rising wedge pattern on the daily chart, suggesting a potential reversal of the uptrend. Additionally, it has fallen below the critical short-term moving average, indicating weakening momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also shown a bearish crossover, indicating increasing selling pressure. Key levels to watch include resistance at 22000 and support at 21800. A drop below 21700 could lead to further correction in the Nifty index. The BankNifty experienced another day of sideways trading, indicating ongoing indecision between bulls and bears, marked by the formation of a doji candle. Key levels to watch include support at 46000 and resistance at 47000, where the highest put and call open interests are concentrated. A breakout beyond this range is awaited for a directional move; however, within the range, the bullish sentiment prevails. Traders may consider adopting a buy-on-dip strategy, with 46000 as a stop-loss level. The rupee depreciated by 13 paise, closing at Rs 83.04 against the US dollar. This decline is primarily driven by a significant rise in the dollar index, which surged by $0.70 to $103.70. This surge stems from a shift in expectations regarding the US Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. Markets now anticipate that the Fed will hold off on interest rate cuts in March, potentially delaying them until June or July. This shift in sentiment has strengthened the dollar across the board, leading to a general weakening of other currencies, including the rupee. Looking ahead, the ongoing two-day policy review by the Fed will be crucial. The tone of the Fed's statements will likely impact the dollar's trajectory. A hawkish stance could further bolster the dollar, potentially pushing it towards $104.50 and weakening the rupee to around 83.20. -India can take a lot more of issuance-Fresh issuance crossing $100 billion will bring fresh set of investors-Fresh issuance crossing 100 billion will bring more investments as it will allow investors, especially FIIs to liquidate positions-Real estate is one white space that's going to grow.

"Benchmark indices the Sensex and the Nifty were trading a tad lower on April 5 morning after the Reserve Bank of India, as expected, kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent for the seventh straight time. Realty were the top performers among rate-sensitive stocks, while autos slipped. The Sensex was down 65.01 points or 0.09 percent at 74,162.62, and the Nifty was down 20.70 points or 0.09 percent at 22,494.00.

Meanwhile, India's 10-year bond yield was stable as it rose by three basis points to 7.12 percent after RBI retained 'withdrawal of accomodation' stance. Announcingthe policy decision, RBI governor Shakikanta Das said that last-mile of disinflation was turning out to be a major challenge globally. ""Services inflation remains sticky in advanced economies. However, the outlook for rural and agricultural activity continues to remain bright,"" Das said. The RBI projected consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 4.5 percent for FY25, assuming normal monsoon. Surplus liquidity talks to spark rate-sensitive stocks, say market experts Apart from that, the RBI updated improvement in liquidity situation in March. ""The liquidity conditions have improved during February and March in the wake of increased government spending, Reserve Bank’s market operations, and the return leg of US dollar and Indian Rupees sale by swap auction,"" he explained. Market experts believe that this RBI's liquidity management efforts may lead to a positive reaction in the stock market, particularly banking stocks. ""Any indication of accommodative monetary policy measures could further bolster investor confidence, potentially driving upward momentum in the stock market. Banking sectors could benefit from the RBI's focus on liquidity management, while sectors sensitive to interest rate changes, such as real estate and infrastructure, may also see some impact,"" said Sonam Srivastava, Founder and Fund Manager at Wright Research. For growth, the Governor mentioned resilient GDP growth across the globe. Das kept real GDP growth for FY25 at 7 percent, Q1FY25 to be 7.1 percent, Q2 to be 6.9 percent and both Q3 and Q4 to be at 7 percent. As RBI maintains FY25 growth forecast, analysts see no hurry to cut rates Equity strategists believe that since India is standing tall on the growth front, the RBI may not be in a hurry to cut interest rates before the US Federal Reserve does. ""The RBI has enough space for holding repo rate steady, with its FY25 GDP growth being quite strong at 7 percent in order to target the 4 percent inflation mark,"" said Suvodeep Rakshit, Senior Economist, Kotak Institutional Equities. Rakshit projects a shallow rate cut cycle from Q3FY25 onwards with the stance changing to neutral in end-Q2FY25 or along with the rate action. Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, too, believes that the RBI will wait-and-watch before initiating a rate cut cycle.

""The disinflation is broadly attributed to easing in momentum across food, fuel, and core items, though some base effects also helped. Headline CPI likely fell 0.12 percent month-on-month (MoM), driven by sequentially lower vegetable, LPG, and gasoline prices,"" said Sodhani.

"Chemical companies in India are clearly looking at the bigger picture. Even as they face a continued global demand slowdown, they are not holding back on capital expenditure to enhance capacity, despite this adding to stress on their balance sheets. However, the near-term pain could mean long-term gain given that the outlook for the country's chemicals sector is robust, especially helped by the capacities coming onstream now. The impact of destocking in Europe and the US has significantly dented global demand, while a decline in Chinese demand has prompted companies there to offload inventories in other regions. This has collectively resulted in a downward pressure on prices. ""In several of the segments, despite a poor global demand, China appears to have been raising its production in 2023, putting downward pressure on realisations, especially for domestic players,"" brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher highlighted. The weak demand environment also coincided with a time when domestic chemical players were going big on capacity expansion to reap the benefits of the growing China+1 sentiment. But in the face of the demand slowdown, chemical players are now feeling the heat of the ongoing capital expenditure, which is weighing on their margins. Slow demand, margin pressure drive bearish ratings on chemical stocks Anticipating prolonged pressure on demand and margins for the chemicals sector, Prabhudas Lilladher, like many other brokerages, opted for a cautious view. The firm has a 'hold' rating on Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Jubilant Ingrevia, Clean Science Technology and Fine Organic Industries. It has a 'reduce' call on SRF, Vinati Organics, Aarti Industries, Deepak Nitrate and NOCIL. The brokerage has a 'sell' recommendation on Laxmi Organic. In contrast, Navin Fluorine emerged as the only chemical stock garnering an upgrade to 'buy' from the brokerage, largely due to the recent correction in the stock price. The concerns of further pressure on the sector become clearer when one looks at their Q3 report card. Chemical companies’ revenues, margins hit In the fiscal third quarter, 8 out of 22 chemical companies recorded their lowest quarterly sales since the COVID-19 outbreak. Four companies’ sales were close to their lowest quarterly numbers since the pandemic. Additionally, 16 of these companies reported a year-on-year decline in revenue. Also Read |Indian chemical players had big hopes riding on China+1, but reality dashes them Furthermore, 12 companies witnessed a drop in gross margins compared to the same quarter last year, with 8 of them also reporting a sequential decline. The situation was more challenging concerning EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margins primarily due to the aggressive capex undertaken. Eighteen companies reported a year-on-year decline while 11 showed a sequential contraction in EBITDA margins.  Pain to continue for a few more quarters The sector was once among India's brighter prospects due to China+1 and a slump in European specialty chemicals production. However, changing dynamics globally suggest that pain due to muted demand and pricing pressure is likely to persist till at least the first quarter of FY25, meaning there is still a long way for the stock prices of chemical companies to recover from a correction that began last year. AK Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital, said the six-month outlook for the sector is not encouraging for investors. ""One or more quarters of bad results will be possible. People who have long-term views need not worry,” he said. Long-term outlook bright While the near-term pressure is most likely to persist, analysts as well as industry participants are bullish on the sector's long-term growth trajectory, also helped by the capacity expansion under way. Maulik Patel, chairman and managing director at chemicals company Epigral, is already seeing green shoots emerging in the domestic market and anticipates global demand to normalise by the end of the first half of FY25. That is when he expects the increased capacity of the domestic chemical industry to begin yielding results. Patel also justifies the capex undertaken by chemical majors even as demand remained muted. He believes the capex will push India up the ladder when competing with China, which is the world's largest producer of chemicals. ""China is strong in the specialty chemical space as it commands a fully vertical integration of production. In that context, Indian chemical companies stood at a disadvantage if they did not move towards the path of vertical integration. Hence, the recent capex unleashed by the industry will help in presenting itself as an alternate vendor to China when demand revives,"" Patel said in an interaction withMoneycontrol. Patel is also betting on the domestic demand to aid a recovery in the industry. ""FY24 turned out to be a tumultuous year for the chemical sector. But now we expect to see improvement in FY25 as demand comes back, while FY26 is likely to turn out much better,"" Patel said. Also Read |Speciality chemical stocks: When will the pain end?

"The week ended March 28 proved to be a resounding success for bullish investors in the domestic markets, leading to a highly optimistic closure for the week, month, and the financial year. Despite being truncated because of two national holidays, the Nifty index consistently traded in the positive territory across sessions. Throughout the last week, there were notable attempts by the benchmark to surpass the significant 22,500 mark, indicating a strong bullish sentiment in the market, although it ultimately closed below this threshold. The last week, however, concluded with gains of over a percent, reflecting the positive momentum and sentiment among investors. Overall, it was a week marked by optimism and upward momentum, underscoring the resilience and confidence in the domestic markets. Last week, our analysis centered around the crucial support of the 50-day exponential moving average (DEMA) for the Nifty index. Additionally, we delved into the bullish harmonic shark pattern and the morning star candlestick pattern. The impact of these technical indicators was evidently observed throughout the week, as they contributed to pulling the index back to the significant 22,500 mark. However, a notable occurrence during the final hour of the preceding trading session led to a substantial pullback, driving the index towards the 22,300 mark, prompting a degree of scepticism in our outlook. Despite our prior bullish stance, we now anticipate fresh rounds of buying activity only if the index surpasses the 22,500 level or nears the 22,100 levels, owing to the emergence of negative divergence in the relative strength index (RSI) across multiple time frames. This divergence signifies a potential short-term reversal in momentum. For the medium term, we maintain our optimistic outlook, asserting that as long as the support at 21,700 remains intact, the index retains the potential for further upward movement. Looking ahead, the short-term support level has been adjusted to 22,000 for the current week starting from April 1, underscoring the dynamic nature of market trends and the importance of vigilant analysis in navigating fluctuations. Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks: Orient Cement: Buy | LTP: Rs 196 | Stop-Loss: Rs 179 | Target: Rs 225 | Return: 15 percent Following a peak near the Rs 293 level, Orient Cement encountered a notable downturn, marked by a sharp decline of 35 percent in its overall value. Despite this downturn, Orient Cement has shown signs of stabilisation around Rs 190 levels for the last week, establishing a sustained support base. It's noteworthy that the level of Rs 190 aligns with the Fibonacci ratio clustering, as indicated in the chart. Moreover, during this period, a 1:1 leg has also formed around this support zone, further reinforcing a bullish sentiment in the stock. An analysis of the daily scale RSI indicator reveals a bullish hidden divergence, suggesting a favourable outlook for Orient Cement. Taking into account these factors along with chart patterns, investors may find it prudent to consider initiating buy positions within the range of Rs 190-198, with an upside objective of Rs 225. To manage the risks effectively, it's advisable to set a stop-loss order at Rs 179 on a daily closing basis, providing protection against potential downside movements.  ABB India: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,361 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,950 | Target: Rs 7,000 | Return: 10 percent In the recent trading session, ABB India showed a significant breakout above the R4 camarilla pivot (Rs 6,111.4), maintaining its position above this level. Additionally, daily stochastics have ventured into the overbought territory, suggesting a bullish momentum anticipated in the upcoming days. The combination of price action persisting above the R4 camarilla pivot and stochastics registering as overbought presents a compelling technical confluence, reinforcing the bullish sentiment surrounding ABB India. Investors may consider initiating a 'buy' position within the range of Rs 6,250-6,400, targeting an upside potential of Rs 7,000, while prudently placing a stop-loss near Rs 5,950 based on the daily closing prices. Hindustan Unilever: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,264 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,145 | Target: Rs 2,500 | Return: 10 percent Since reaching its peak around the Rs 2,669 mark on January 1, 2024, Hindustan Unilever has experienced a notable downturn, witnessing a significant decline of approximately 16 percent. However, in the subsequent six trading sessions, Hindustan Unilever has displayed resilience, avoiding further declines and instead consolidating within a range spanning from Rs 2,230 to Rs 2,280. Notably, within this price range, a bullish AB=CD pattern has formed on the daily chart of Hindustan Unilever. This range also corresponds with the 0.50 percent retracement level of a price swing observed between March 2022 and July 2023, as depicted on the chart. Additionally, on a daily scale, the RSI has exhibited a complex structure (W shape) along with some regular bull divergence on the 4-hour chart. Interestingly, the mentioned range of Rs 2,230-2,280 aligns with S5 Camarilla Pivot (Rs 2,243), suggesting a potentially attractive buying opportunity. Therefore, it might be prudent to consider buying within the range of Rs 2,250-2,280, aiming for an upside target of Rs 2,500, while setting a stop-loss near Rs 2,145 on a daily closing basis. This comprehensive analysis highlights potential trading opportunities and risk management strategies for traders and investors considering positions in Hindustan Unilever.
","Week Summary: The Nifty index closed with gains of over 1%, marking a positive week for bullish investors. Support at 22,500 mark remained intact, indicating a strong bullish sentiment despite the truncated trading period. Technical indicators like DEMA and candlestick patterns contributed to the upward momentum. Although the index reached the mentioned 22,500 mark, a substantial pullback occurred near the end of the trading session. Fresh buying activity is anticipated only if the index surpasses the 22,500 level or near the 22,100 levels.Buy Recommendations (next 2-3 weeks): Orient Cement: Buy within Rs 190-198 for potential upside of Rs 225. ABB India: Buy within Rs 6,250-6,400 for a potential upside of Rs 7,000. Hindustan Unilever: Buy within Rs 2,250-2,280 for an upside potential of Rs 2,500."

"Domestic benchmark indices the Sensex and the Nifty fell for the second consecutive day on April 3 morning, tracking dull global cues and rising US bond yields. Equity experts, however, maintained their bullish bias and said upward movement is anticipated in the coming days. The Sensex was down 271.96 points, or 0.37 percent, at 73,631.95 and the Nifty was down 83.60 points, or 0.37 percent, at 22,369.70 on opening deals.

""The support for the day is seen at 22,200 level, while resistance would be seen at 22,600,"" she said. Follow our live blog for all the market action The spoiler of the current bullish sentiment is the rising treasury bond yields, said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. The 10-year US treasury note jumped to 4.3 percent, the highest level seen since November 2, 2023. The spike came after traders reassessed possibility of the Federal Reserve rate cuts in June. The odds for a June rate cut rate based on fed futures trading was down roughly to 63 percent, off from about 70 percent a week ago, according to CME-FedWatch tool. The moves came after investors interpreted expansion in US manufacturing for the first time since September 2022. Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services viewed that the rate cut possibility from the Fed was fading since labour market remained tight and rising crude fueled inflation fears. ""Even though the Fed chief has been sounding dovish recently, the market is now less optimistic about 3 rate cuts in 2024. This will continue to be a drag on equity markets globally,"" he highlighted.

Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities The index has remained sideways throughout the session, reflecting a pause in the market trend following the formation of a hanging man pattern. The sentiment may continue to remain sideways due to the lack of a directional breakout or pattern formation. At the higher end, 22650 might prove to be a crucial resistance level. A fresh rally is not anticipated as long as the index remains below 22650. On the lower end, support is evident at 22300; if breached, the index might decline towards the 22000-21900 range. Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas The Nifty opened on a weak note and consolidated during the day. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty consolidated and traded within the range of the previous trading session. The Nifty appears to be consolidating after a sharp run-up which is a healthy sign. We expect the consolidation to breakout on the upside and thus minor degree corrections should be bought into. On the upside we expect levels of 22700 which is the upper end of the rising channel. On the downside crucial support is placed at 22400 – 22350. As far as Bank Nifty is concerned, it has been outperforming and we expect the outperformance to continue. On the upside the immediate hurdle is placed at 48636 and above that the rally is likely to continue till 49300. The zone of 47700 – 47500 shall act as a crucial support zone from short term perspective. On the downside 48000 is the crucial support from short term perspective. Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research, Religare Broking The recent consolidation in Nifty amid weak global cues indicates time-wise correction and traders should maintain a positive bias until the Nifty holds 22,200 level. However, stock selection is tricky in the prevailing scenario due to a mixed trend across sectors so traders should maintain extra caution on that part. Besides, one shouldn’t go overboard and restrict positions in quality midcap and smallcap names.

"Analyst optimism on the near-term prospects of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, India’s largest drugmaker, runs high, with the stock continuing to command the maximum ‘buy’ calls and the highest percentage of ‘buy’ calls. The optimism stems from Sun Pharma's strong presence in the global specialty space, where the company stands way ahead of rivals, and a robust outlook for its India business. Specialty drugs are medicines to treat chronic, complex, and rare diseases. The stock has consistently featured as one of the top pharma picks for most brokerages.Moneycontrol's Analyst Call Tracker shows that Sun Pharma has 34 'buy' calls from 41 brokerages that cover the company, taking the optimism for the stock to almost 83 percent. Only one brokerage has a 'sell' recommendation and six have a 'hold' rating. Sun Pharma’s better-than-expected financial results in the third quarter of FY24 ushered confidence among analysts. The company's US sales grew at a brisk pace while the India business remained strong. Consolidated net profit for Q3 jumped 16.5 percent on-year while revenue rose a little over 10 percent. Revenue from the US and India business as well as the global specialty segment grew in double digits.

The global specialty vertical, which makes up over 16 percent of the company's sales, also registered the strongest on-year growth of 24.2 percent in Q3. Analysts at ICICI Securities see wide room for growth in the segment. The drugmaker is likely to file for skin cancer drug Nidlegy in Europe in the second half of calendar year 2024, which will boost its specialty sales in the near term. Dilip Shanghvi, managing director of Sun Pharma, said the company will soon file for Nidlegy with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). ""Once approved, Nidlegy will significantly expand our onco-derm franchise in Europe,” Sanghvi said. Prabhudas Lilladher said the acquisition of Concert Pharmaceuticals, a US biopharmaceuticals company, along with progress in other drugs provide further visibility to Sun Pharma's specialty pipeline beyond FY25. The brokerage has Sun Pharma as its top pick in the sector. Strong domestic outlook Aside from the drugmaker's presence in the global specialty space, its strong performance in the domestic market has made analysts optimistic. Sun Pharma reported low double-digit growth in India in Q3, but ICICI Securities said new market representatives are helping Sun Pharma gain market share and boost volume growth. The company expanded its portfolio by launching 28 products in Q3, which stand to benefit from the growing network of medical representatives. Sharekhan raised its earnings-per-share target for Sun Pharma by 1-3 percent for FY25/26, backed by the continued traction in its specialty portfolio and dominant position in the Indian market. The drugmaker's shares have delivered close to 30 percent returns year-to-date as against the 12 percent rise in the BSE Healthcare index. The stock trades at a trailing 12-month PE of 43.64 times.

The normal acreage for the season, which is the average of the past three years, is 1.1 mln ha. Bajra, paddy, sesamum, and moong are the main crops grown in the state during summer. Summer crops are grown for a short time period between Kharif and Rabi crops, mainly from March to June. The total area under cereals was 313,286 ha, up from last year's area of 307,480 ha. The area under bajra, the key crop grown during summer, was lower at 214,670 ha from last year's acreage of 222,566 ha. However, paddy was sown over 92,505 ha, up 17.5% from last year. Paddy is the second-largest cereal grown in the state. Pulses grown during the season are urad and moong. The acreage under pulses was 57,000 ha, down from 58,476 last year.

Such a move will ensure market stability and the welfare of farmers, the association's president, Ajay Jhunjhunwala, wrote in the letter. Currently, market prices of mustard are below the minimum support price of 5,650 rupees per 100 kg, and this necessitates immediate government intervention,the association said. On Thursday, prices in Jaipur were 5,475-5,500 rupees per 100 kg, according to traders. Minimum support price remains a concern, as the oilseed harvesting season is underway, SEA said.""Despite reaching a peak of 100 lakh (10 mln) hectares in acreage during the current season, mustard cultivation faces stagnation due to declining prices,"" it said. India has maintained a policy of free export of oilseeds, oilmeals, and edible oil alongside unrestricted import capabilities that affect the domestic market negatively. Excess imports have led to surplus inventory, posing a challenge to both the government and the industry. ""Import dependency for edible oils continues to escalate annually, with last year witnessing imports of 165 lakh tonnes (16.5 mln tn) valued at Rs. 1.4 lakh crores (1.4 trln rupees),"" he SEA said.

Volume in Tuesday's session was almost twice the average 30 days traded volume of the stock. With the stock trading well above its important moving averages, an immediate major support is placed at Rs 250 mark, below which the stock would lose its strength. Positional players are advised to keep a strict stop-loss at Rs 250 mark and aim for upside potential targets of Rs 302 and Rs 305 on the stock as this bullish momentum continues. We advise investors to maintain a hold and a buy-on-dips approach for the stock, with a strict stop-loss. Gujarat Pipavav Port The stock is approaching a crucial resistance zone of Rs 217-219 on its daily charts. With the volume on the stock being nearly 3 times its average 30 days traded volume, the momentum on the stock looks positive, and the stock looks poised for a good breakout above its crucial mark of Rs 220. A move above Rs 220 should trigger a fresh upside move towards Rs 240 and Rs 250 in the stock. An immediate support is expected to be placed at Rs 200 mark, below which the stock would lose its strength. We advise investors to maintain a hold and add aggressively above Rs 220 mark for the stock with a strict stop-loss.  Hindustan Aeronautics The stock has given a good breakout above its recent anchor VWAP (volume-weighted average price) resistance mark of Rs 3,149 and managed to give a good bullish closing at Rs 3,300 mark. Going forward, any pullback towards Rs 3,120 - 3,150 zone should offer a good buying opportunity on the stock with a strict stop-loss kept at Rs 2,900 level for potential upside targets of Rs 3,500 and Rs 3,750. We advise investors to maintain a hold and a buy-on-dips approach for the stock with a strict stop-loss.

Shah also highlighted from an Open Interest (OI) perspective, ""Banknifty PCR is currently above 1.20, with significant call writing seen at 48,500-48,700 strikes and 48,500-48,400 puts, implying a range of 48,200 to 49,000 for the next few days with a bullish bias.""
"," Bank Nifty reached a new record high of 48,716.95 during trading session on April 8th. HDFC Bank has been gaining momentum along with peers Axis and IndusInd Bank since last week.

"The Nifty 50 managed to close above 22,500 at last, but sustainability above this level for few sessions is the key for further upward journey. As, above the same, the index is likely to hit 22,700-22,800 levels, while 22,300 is expected to act as a key support for the index in an immediate term, experts said. Hence, on the overall, the trading range may be 22,300-22,600 for the near term. On April 4, the Nifty 50 climbed 80 points to 22,515 and formed bearish candlestick pattern with long lower shadow on the daily charts, indicating healthy buying interest at lower levels. The BSE Sensex rose 351 points to 74,228, while the broader markets have maintained uptrend with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices rising 0.01 percent and 0.45 percent. Stocks that clocked healthy gains and performed better than the benchmark as well as the broader markets included HDFC Bank, Zomato, and Muthoot Finance.HDFC Bank, after recent consolidation breakout, reached closer to 200-day EMA (exponential moving average) of Rs 1,532. The stock rallied 3 percent to Rs 1,527.6 and formed bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with double the volume over previous day.

Zomatoended at new closing high of Rs 187 on the NSE, up 4.88 percent and formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily scale with above average volumes. The stock traded above all key moving averages. Muthoot Financejumped over 2 percent to Rs 1,666.55, the highest closing level since November 15, 2021 and formed bullish candlestick pattern with lower shadow on the daily charts. The volumes were on the higher side for last couple of weeks, while the stock traded far above all key moving averages. Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: HDFC Bank After short-term correction from the higher levels, the counter was trading in a rectangle formation. However, on the daily and weekly charts there is a range breakout in the counter along with decent volume activity, which suggest a new leg of bullish trend in the near term. Unless it is trading below Rs 1,470 positional traders can retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 1,640.  Muthoot Finance The stock has given a breakout of its Ascending Triangle chart pattern on the weekly scale. Additionally, the incremental volume activity of the stock indicates the beginning of a new up move from the current levels. For positional traders, Rs 1,600 would be the trend decider level. Trading above the same uptrend formation will continue till Rs 1,770. However, if it closes below Rs 1,600 traders may prefer to exit from trading long positions.  Zomato After the robust rally on the daily scale, the stock went into the consolidation mode. However, the recent breakout in the stock is representing a bullish continuation pattern signifying a new leg of up move from the current levels. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 180 the uptrend formation is likely to continue. Above which, the counter could move up to Rs 202. On the flip side, fresh sell off possible only after dismissal of Rs 180. 
","Nifty 50 The index closed above 22,500, but it needs to sustain above this level for a few sessions to continue its upward journey. The index may hit the range of 22,300-22,800, while 22,300 is expected to act as a key support for the index in an immediate term.

"The Nifty 50 index threw up volatile trading on March 20. The overall sentiment in the market remained negative as the index closed below the previous consolidation low. Additionally, the index ended the session below the critical moving average. However, a further fall is anticipated below the recent swing low on the hourly chart, around 21,700. On the higher end, the resistance is placed at 21,900-22,000. The Bank Nifty encountered another round of volatility with the struggle between bulls and bears continuing unabated. Key support lies within the 46,000-45,800 zone, and maintaining these levels on a closing basis suggests a continued bullish stance. Immediate resistance is seen at 47,000, coinciding with the 20-DMA (day moving average), and a decisive close above this level could reignite the upward trend, targeting levels around 48,000-48,500. Here are three buy calls for the short term: Container Corporation of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 840 | Stop-Loss: Rs 800 | Target: Rs 880/900 | Return: 7 percent A bullish opportunity presents itself in this stock, marked by a Hammer candlestick formation at daily chart support. Coupled with oversold conditions indicated by RSI (relative strength index) below 30, it offers a favourable risk-to-reward ratio. Consider initiating a long position within the range of Rs 830-840, one can set a stop-loss below the 200-day moving average at Rs 805, with a target at Rs 880.  Power Grid Corporation of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 265 | Stop-Loss: Rs 257 | Target: Rs 274/280 | Return: 6 percent Despite recent market volatility, the stock has demonstrated signs of stability, hinting at a potential turnaround. It's approaching a crucial point, aiming to surpass its 50EMA (exponential moving average) at Rs 268, which could amplify its upward momentum. Additionally, the RSI, in oversold territory, suggests a potential bounce from current levels. Key support is identified at Rs 257, serving as a cushion against downside risks, while upside targets are set at Rs 274 and Rs 280.  State Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 736 | Stop-Loss: Rs 710 | Target: Rs 770/790 | Return: 7 percent The stock has found support slightly above its 50EMA, signaling a potential reversal, particularly on lower time frames. Momentum, as indicated by the RSI, is poised for a bullish crossover, adding strength to the stock's upward potential. Key support rests at Rs 710, while upside targets are set at Rs 770 and Rs 790.

The negativity in Hong Kong and China markets after the Bank of Japan's decision to hike interest rates after 17 years spilled over to the Indian market.

"ICICI Securities research report onPrince Pipes and Fittings Prince Pipes (PRINCPIP) has announced an asset-based purchase of bathware brand Aquel (faucetware plant capacity of 0.1mn pieces p.a.) for a cash consideration of INR 550mn (funded via internal accruals). Aquel is a 25-year-old brand with presence in western, central and certain parts of southern India. Aquel’s current promoters have sold the business to PRINCPIP due to financial stress. We believe this acquisition was necessary for PRINCPIP to have a manufacturing base in faucets, which is a pre-requisite for growing the bathware segment. As per PRINCPIP management, it can capitalise Aquel’s dealer mindshare by regular servicing. This acquisition is likely to boost PRINCPIP’s plans of being a notable player in the bathware segment. However, revenue contribution from this segment may remain small (<5%) in the near term. Outlook For pipes segment, management has guided for flat YoY volume growth in Q4FY24 and expects industry leading volume growth from Q1FY25. We cut our EBIDTA estimates by ~2-4% over FY24-26E but upgrade the stock to BUY (from Add), led by stock price correction, with a revised Mar’25 TP of INR 723 (earlier INR 739).

Metal stocks on a roll Indian Metal stocks have been in an upgrade following data coming out of China which indicated that the manufacturing sector is seeing a rebound which may lead to a rise in demand for metals. Vinit Bolinjkar of Ventura Securities told Moneycontrol that aside from a positive manufacturing update from China, the commodities sector is at the start of a structural bull cycle, expected to last eight to 10 years. Another reason for the rise in metal prices is the global infrastructure thrust and increasing defence spends, which has spurred the demand for metals, Bolinjkar said. As the demand for copper, zinc and lead rise, the supply dries up, causing prices to shoot up.

"Medicines included in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) will see a slight increase in prices from April 1. The adjusted prices will cover more than 800 drugs on the National List of Essential Medicines. Price changes for scheduled drugs are allowed once a year. From April 2024, companies can take a 0.0055 percent hike. Every year, the National Pharma Pricing Authority (NPPA) announces a calculated ceiling of prices based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) of the previous calendar year. This limits the percentage hike drug companies can take on their portfolio under NLEM starting April. “Based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) data provided by the office of the Economic Advisor, Department of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the annual change in WPI works out as (+)0.00551% during the calendar year 2023 over the corresponding period in 2022,” the notification from the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) said. Essential medicines are those that satisfy the priority healthcare needs of a majority of the population. The essential medicines list needs to be country specific, addressing the disease burden of the nation and the commonly used medicines at primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare levels. The medicines in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) should be available at affordable costs and with assured quality. The NPPA regularly updates and maintains the list of products under NLEM. After annual increases of 12 percent and 10 percent in prices in 2023 and 2022, this will be a meagre increase for the industry. However, it might not be a big blow to the listed pharmaceutical players according to an expert. ““NLEM medicines are not a majority component of the Indian pharma companies;  the non-NLEM portfolio of the company has around roughly 80 percent and the NLEM portion in the domestic sales that we have is around 15 to 20 percent,” said Bhavesh Shah, Managing Director and Head-Investment Banking, Equirus. The Indian pharmaceutical market grew 6.8 percent in calendar year 2023. Price was a major growth factor in 2023 as volumes were down marginally by 0.9 percent.

"Motilal Oswal's research report onNMDC The domestic demand for iron ore is expected to move in tandem with infrastructure and construction growth. NMDC, being the largest domestic iron ore miner, is expected to produce ~45mt of iron ore in FY24 (production for 11MFY24 has crossed 40.2mt), surpassing production of over 40mt for the third year in a row. It is well on track to exceed 50mt of production in FY25E and 55mt in FY26E. NMDC has planned capex for several evacuation and capacity enhancement projects, which should improve the product mix and augment its production capacity to ~100mt by FY29-30E. The domestic steel sector is well placed compared to its global peers and the domestic crude steel capacity is expected to reach ~175mt in FY24 with ~82% capacity utilization. This would translate to ~282mt of iron ore requirement in FY24E, with NMDC commanding a ~16% market share. Similarly, as crude steel capacity inches up to 300mt by FY30-31, total demand for iron ore would be ~435-445mt. We believe NMDC, with a dominant presence in the domestic market, is well placed to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead. Outlook NMDC trades at 4.5x FY26E EV/EBITDA and 1.7x FY26E P/B. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a TP of INR260. Key risks: 1) ~105 iron ore blocks have been auctioned since FY16 (~57 blocks auctioned in FY23 and FY24E) of which ~30 mines are operational; when the remaining captive mines become operational, it would lead to an increase in the supply of iron ore, thus increasing the competition for NMDC; 2) NMDC relies heavily on a few customers, which exposes the company to business risk.

Taking Stock: Markets snap 3-day rise; Sensex down 362 pts, Nifty falls 92 pts, mid-caps outperform The broader indices outperformed the main indices with BSE Midcap index rising 0.7 percent and Smallcap index closed flat.... Read More Nifty traded in negative territory throughout the session. Broader market however outperformed with Nifty midcap and smallcap 100 up 1% and 0.4% respectively. Sector-wise it was a mixed bag with buying seen in Realty, Oil & Gas, and Consumer Durables. Shorten trading week, derivatives monthly expiry along with global economic data to be released this week has kept the investors on the side-lines. Overall, we expect the market to consolidate in a broader range, however, buying in a broader market before the financial year end cannot be ruled out. Investors would watch for US Consumer confidence data to be released late today. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty is broadly trading in the range 21880- 22200 since the last three trading sessions. The range-bound action is likely to continue in the absence of any near-term triggers. Also, as we near the monthly expiry of the March series derivative contracts the volatility seems to have dried down resulting in to range-bound moves. The contraction of the hourly Bollinger bands also suggests sideway price action. Thus, multiple parameters are suggesting that Nifty is likely to witness subdued price action over the next few trading sessions. Stock specific action likely to continue during this period. Bank Nifty also consolidated within a narrow range around the key daily moving averages. On the downside 46500 is acting as a crucial support while 46900 is acting as an immediate hurdle. Overall, we expect the Bank Nifty to resume its retracement towards 47000 – 47200 over the next few trading sessions. The Bank Nifty index experienced a subdued start to the truncated week with sideways trading. Immediate resistance is noted at 47000, and a decisive close above this level could trigger significant short-covering rallies towards the 48000 mark. Conversely, immediate support is situated around the 46500-46450 zone. A breach below this support area may accelerate downside momentum towards the 46000 level. Investors resorted to profit-taking due to lack of enthusiasm in a truncated week. Markets were mostly range-bound with a negative bias as frontline technology stocks were at the receiving end on concerns that subdued global economy may lead to muted IT spending by big clients this year. Aligned with global trends, the domestic market sustained its consolidation pattern, ending close to 22,000. While key data such as US GDP and inflation during the week may provide some clues on future rate cut paths, the fiscal year-ending truncated week, coupled with reduced trading volumes and monthly expiry, are likely to contribute to volatility. Generally, midcaps are performing well post the consolidation of the last 2-3 weeks, while the IT sector continued to experience sluggishness following weak global IT spending forecasts. Nifty remained sideways throughout the day as market participants stayed perplexed on the first day of the holiday-shortened week. However, the trend remained positive for the short term as the index closed above the critical moving average on the daily chart. On the lower end, support is placed at 21,840 for the short term, below which weakness may emerge. On the higher end, resistance is visible at 22,240-22,300. Indian bourses began the truncated week on a tepid note and remained rangebound throughout the day to close the session at 22,004.70 with a loss of 92.05 points. Among the sectors, Realty was the top performer while Media was the major laggard followed by IT. Buying traction was seen more in the broader markets as Mid and Smallcaps gained by 1.05% & 0.41% and outperformed the Nifty50.

"The hare and the tortoise story is only too familiar to everyone. Wonder how does it manifest in stock markets? Well, you have the tortoise stocks that are consistent. They're not fast, but keep inching ahead steadily. The hare stocks make big leaps and worn out soon. At the end of the story, the tortoise wins the race. In the midcap rally of FY24, which sent the BSE Midcap index simmering with 63 percent up, 23 stocks out of the 111 on the index, turned out to be multi-baggers that at least doubled in value. But only four stocks were the triumphant tortoise: Trent, Aurobindo Pharma, Lupin and Solar Industries. These stocks showed steady trades, low volatility or what is called ‘beta’ in high finance, compared with the market barometer Sensex, and yet at the end of the year, landed themselves in leading positions. Stocks with a beta higher than 1 are seen as more volatile than the index. Their rise is higher than that of the Sensex when it moves up and their fall is also deeper than the index when it falls. A stock with a beta value of less than 1 usually means that it will rise less than the benchmark on the way up, but also fall less on the way down.  Consistent performers The trajectory through the fiscal for all four stocks show remarkable consistency with three of them showing a steady climb all through the year without any significant drawdown. Only Solar Industries had a 5 percent decline. Also read:Higher returns with lower volatility: Select indices beat NSE Nifty 50 in past one year Over the past three years, all these three stocks showed a steady growth in the bottomline: 47 percent CAGR for Trent, 42 percent for Lupin and 41 percent for Solar Industries. Aurobindo Pharma, however, has shown a drop in net profit growth in this period. At a net profit of Rs 623.8 crore for the December quarter, Aurobindo Pharma recorded an uptick of 109 percent over the previous corresponding quarter. Its operating profit margins improved from 13.79 percent to 17.89 percent in the past 5 quarters. In spite of the steady price gains, Axis Direct has a 'buy' rating on the stock, given its stronger-than-expected earnings and future expansion plans. Motilal Oswal has a 'buy' tag on Trent on strong revenue productivity, aggressive store additions, margin tailwinds from moderating RM, and operating leverage. Net profits for Trent jumped 113 percent to Rs 343.6 crore in the December quarter of FY24 from Rs 161 crore a year back, while revenue increased 51 percent to Rs 3,389 crore from Rs 2,244 crore and operating profit margins improved  to 18.81 percent from 15.45 percent. Lupin’s net profit zoomed to Rs 916 crore in the December quarter from Rs 40.4 crore a year ago. IKts operating profit margins expanded to 29.58 percent from 7.52 percent and revenue jumped to Rs 4,138 crore from Rs 2,878 crore in the past 5 quarters. SBI securities is bullish on the stock, given its leadership in certain geographies, strong product portfolio and pipeline and strong quarterly results. Solar Industries saw its operating profit margins expand to 21.27 percent from 14.69 percent between the last two December quarters with the net profits jumping to Rs 138.3 crore from Rs 115.6 crore. Hem Securities has a 'buy' call on the stock as it believes the company is expected to perform well on the back of strong growth in exports and in overseas operations, steady demand from mining and infra sector and healthy execution in defence segment. Better performance from overseas subsidiaries on the back of strong demand, revenue increase from non-CIL customers in coal segment is expected even as defence and export segments are seen picking up due to diversified portfolio. On technical charts, all these four midcaps are indicating bullish signals. Darpan Patil of Rupic consultancy feels technical chart of Trent looks good and the shares are getting ready for the next leg of rally.

"Indian healthcare provider Narayana Hrudayalaya expects to roll out its insurance service by the first quarter of FY25, seeking to disrupt the status quo, a top company official said. “We hope that in Q1 of the coming financial year we will be able to go live with our first product,” said Sandhya J, group CFO atNarayana Health. The company, also known as Narayana Health, received approval from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India to launch a health insurance business in India in January 2024. While acknowledging that the hospital-insurer combination could be seen as a conflict of interest, Narayana said its intention is to change the status quo. “We believe that we will be able to disrupt the way health services are consumed in the country,” said Sandhya. She emphasised the importance of health checkups that could reduce future hospitalisation expenses. Most health insurance providers cover only illnesses that require hospitalisation. Only a few provide cover for outpatient expenses such as doctor consultations and pharmacy spending. “We will have different products to cater to different segments of the population. Some of these will cover outpatient also,” Sandhya said. “Some products will focus on economical solutions targeting the missing middle (those who cannot afford insurance today), so we will cover across the spectrum.” Also read:India a main force in Asian Healthcare deal activity: Bain & Co Capex plans The company's capital expenditure was about Rs 1,000 crore in FY24, a level it hopes to maintain for the next few years. “We are expecting to spend in the same range - about Rs 1,000 crore - at least for the next few years because of the kind of expansion plan that we have targeted,” Sandhya said. Most of the spending in FY24 went into expansion of the company’s centre in the Cayman Islands. The centre is nearing completion and will have more daycare facilities. The capex for the next financial year will focus on India, according to the management. “Most of this expenditure will happen in India as Cayman expansion is complete,” Sandhya said. Narayana Hrudayalaya was allotted 7.26 acres of land in Kolkata on a freehold basis to set up a healthcare facility by the state housing infrastructure corporation in February 2024. The capex will focus on this site and the flagship hospital in Bengaluru. The company operates a chain of multispecialty, tertiary and primary healthcare facilities. Founded in 2000 by Devi Shetty, with over 30 years of medical experience, the group initially concentrated on cardiac and renal sciences and later expanded its scope to include cancer care, neurology, neurosurgery, orthopaedics, and gastroenterology. In 2013, the organisation rebranded itself as Narayana Health to better represent its diversified presence. With a significant presence in southern Karnataka and eastern India, it is gradually establishing itself in the western, central, and northern regions of the country. In February 2024, ICRA rated the company as stable. The stable outlook on the long-term rating reflects ICRA’s expectations that Narayana Health will continue to benefit from its strong market position, investments in technology and ramp-up of operations at new centres.

""The capex cycle theme drives several of our top picks (Ambuja, Axis, JSW Energy, L&T, Macrotech). Other themes to play include government manufacturing push (Amber), state-owned enterprise reforms (SBI), penetration stories (Max Health, Zomato), financialisation of savings (Axis, SBI) and key consumer / bottom-of-pyramid ideas (Bharti, TVS)."" Let's take a look the 11 stocks that made it to Jefferies list of top picks. Amber Enterprises:Jefferies touted Amber Enterprises as the key beneficiary of India's manufacturing growth narrative, particularly within the small and midcap space. The company's core competency in ACs and diversification into components, supported by the government's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, is projected to drive a CAGR of 36 percent in earnings from 2024 to 2030. Ambuja Cements:As the second-largest cement producer in India, Ambuja Cements is expected to achieve strong operational performance compared to its peers. Factors contributing to the bullishness include the company's increased capacity, cost cutting and investments in green power, which combined are expected to drive 19 percent EBITDA CAGR. Axis Bank:Jefferies forecasts an earnings per share (EPS) CAGR of 18 percent for Axis Bank from 2024 to 2029. This growth trajectory is attributed to improvements in deposit franchises, ramp-ups in the digital and lending platforms, and the expansion of subsidiaries. The integration of Citibank India is also seen as a catalyst for cost and revenue synergies, while initiatives like hyper-personalisation platforms and loans for small and rural enterprises are expected to drive loan growth. Jefferies also sees potential for valuation re-rating. Follow our live blog for all the market action Bharti Airtel:Jefferies has a favourable opinion on Bharti Airtel due to its consistent market share gains and improving pricing environment, with room for growth in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). The brokerage expects a 12 percent to 13 percent CAGR in India revenue or EBITDA from 2024 to 2030, driven by market share expansion and higher ARPU. The generation of consistent free cash flow is seen as a factor that could lead to a shift in valuation benchmarks towards free cash flow yields, Jefferies believes. JSW Energy:Jefferies outlines three potential triggers for JSW Energy over the next 12-24 months, including increased visibility in renewable energy capacity, commissioning of a 700 MW merchant capacity during peak power demand, and progress on green hydrogen plants and energy storage batteries. The company's execution capabilities and prudent cash flow utilisation are expected to maintain elevated multiples and create shareholder value in the medium term. Larsen & Toubro:Jefferies identifies Larsen & Toubro (L&T) as a significant beneficiary of India's capital expenditure upswing, projecting a 25 percent EPS CAGR and an 18-20 percent return on equity (RoE). The potential for re-rating is also open given sustained EPS growth and shareholder-friendly capital allocation policies. However, risks include management's capital allocation decisions and government spending on infrastructure. Macrotech Developers:According to Jefferies,Macrotech Developers stands to benefit from the current housing capex cycle and its substantial land bank in Mumbai's suburbs. Jefferies expects a 15-20 percent medium-term pre-sales CAGR driven by land value resets and expansion into new geographies. Max Healthcare:Jefferies sees Max Healthcare as a potentially lucrative investment with sustained growth momentum in the hospital business. The brokerage expects a 20 percent average EBITDA growth rate from 2024-30, driven by new bed additions and efficient operations. However, the brokerage also sees some risks for the healthcare firm which include construction delays and overpriced acquisitions. State Bank of India:Jefferies has an optimistic view of the State Bank of India's (SBI) prospects, citing its strong deposit base, digital offerings, and leadership in lending segments. Alongside, the ability to raise capital and potential valuation re-rating are viewed as growth drivers. TVS Motor:Jefferies expects TVS Motor to benefit from the revival in Indian two-wheeler demand, narrowing profitability gaps with peers, and strong earnings growth prospects. However, the brokerage stands concerned over the company's investments in overseas entities with unclear strategies. Zomato:Jefferies considers Zomato as a compelling food delivery investment with strong growth potential and profitability. EBITDA break-even for Blinkit and visible profit pool growth over the next five years are key upside triggers, with capital allocation strategies being a key factor to monitor.

"In the holiday-shortened week, the broader indices performed in line with the main indices amid volatility. The support from FIIs narrowed the current account deficit in Q4, and mixed global cues led equity indices to finish near record highs on the final day of the FY24. This week, BSE Sensex gained 819.41 or 1 percent to end at 73,651.35 and the Nifty50 index added 260 points or 1 percent to finish at 22,326.90. Among broader indices, the BSE Small-cap, Mid-cap and Large-cap indices rose 1.8 percent, 1.4 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. On the sectoral front, the Nifty Realty index gained 5 percent, Nifty Oil & Gas was up 2 percent and Nifty Auto and Healthcare indices added 1.7 percent each. In comparison, Nifty Media index shed 3 percent and Nifty Information Technology index added a loss of 0.8 percent. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) turned net buyers in this week as they bought equities worth of Rs 2368.76 crore, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) continued their support as they bought equities worth Rs 8,913.49 crore. In FY24, BSE Mid, Small and Largecap indices surged 63 percent, 60 percent and 32 percent, respectively. On the other hand, BSE Sensex and Nifty rose 25 percent and 28.6 percent, respectively. ""FY24 marked a rewarding period for the Indian market. The upgrade in FY24 economy growth loaded it, as the Indian GDP forecast was uplifted on a QoQ basis from 6.4% to 7.3% during the year. There was a rampage in corporate earnings growth, like with the 23-24% YoY EPS forecast for the Nifty50 index. Retail inflows remained robust, supported by direct investments and investments through MFs. The number of trading accounts held by domestic investors reached 16.7cr, underscoring increased market participation. Additionally, FIIs exhibited improved net buying activity, buoyed by India's economic outperformance relative to other EMs experiencing slowdowns,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. ""However, the year ended on a subdued note, with substantial selling pressure till the 20th of March. Nevertheless, there has been some relief in the market in recent trading sessions as the pressure from leveraged selling has eased and buying activity has improved, albeit at lower volumes."" ""In the coming first week of April, there is a flurry of significant data releases expected, like PMI in the US and India, factory orders, and unemployment data in the US. Additionally, market participants will closely monitor signals regarding policy rates, particularly from the RBI. Moreover, attention will be on India's Q4FY24 result forecasts, which are expected to indicate a healthy performance."" ""As we move on to a new financial year, we express optimism towards sectors such as Pharma, Capital Goods, and Infra, as we see them as key growth drivers, supported by both domestic and external demand. Although some sectors like FMCG and IT are facing challenges due to subdued demand at present, we anticipate a turnaround, driven by expectations of a normal monsoon and increased US demand following the Fed's rate cut. However, the focus is on large caps, as the premium valuation of Midcaps could have a hiccup in the short to medium-term,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index added nearly 1 percent with 26 stocks gave double digit return including Sanghvi Movers, Bharat Bijlee, Technocraft Industries (India), Transformers and Rectifiers India, Manorama Industries, Aegis Logistics, Angel One, Schneider Electric Infrastructure, among others. However, EKI Energy Services, Sanmit Infra, Primo Chemicals, Jindal Poly Films, Dhani Services and OnMobile Global fell between 10-14 percent.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities The Nifty rallied significantly, surpassing the 22,500 mark after maintaining momentum beyond 22,100. Furthermore, there's a clear breakout in consolidation on the daily timeframe, signaling rising optimism. Nevertheless, the Nifty encountered initial resistance near its previous swing high of 22,526. Consequently, to sustain a continued rally, it must surpass the 22,525 level decisively. On the downside, 22,200 could serve as short-term support. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities While markets may witness wild fluctuations due to valuations of benchmark indices being in an expensive zone, the undertone still remains bullish as investors are willing to bet big on equity assets for the next financial year too. While focus will shift to full year earnings from next month, sectors like banking and IT companies will be in focus going ahead. Although corrections at every interval will provide investors an opportunity to revisit mid & small-cap stocks, large-cap stocks could attract more attention going ahead.

However, the company is likely to report double-digit volume growth in 4QFY24, supported by healthy demand and market share gains. We cut our EBITDA estimates by 4%/8%/8% for FY24/FY25/FY26 due to weak pricing, which was partly offset by higher volume growth and cost reduction initiatives. Further, a delay in the acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates (JPA)’s cement assets (announced in Dec’22) remains an overhang on the stock. The approval process from various banks is pending and is taking longer than anticipated. However, DALBHARA’s organic expansion plans are on track. It will add clinker and cement capacities of 4.9mtpa each through a mix of greenfield and brownfield expansions by FY25. Outlook The stock has corrected 15% in the last three months due to concerns of lower profitability because of a decline in cement prices. We value the stock at 12x FY26E (earlier 13x) EV/EBITDA to arrive at our revised TP of INR2,500 (earlier INR2,800). The stock offers an upside potential of 25% from current levels. Reiterate BUY.

"The recent consolidation and decisive breakdowns in technical parameters have caused the momentum to turn in favour of bears. Therefore, traders need to be cautious with 21,800 being a key area for further direction in the Nifty 50. If the index breaks this level, then the selling pressure may extend to 21,700 and then to the 21,500 mark. However, in case of a rebound, experts predict that 22,000 is expected to be the immediate resistance for the index. On March 19, the BSE Sensex plunged 736 points to 72,012, while the Nifty 50 slipped 238 points to 21,817.

The stock rose 3 percent to Rs 120 with strong volumes and formed a bullish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily charts, indicating selling pressure at higher levels. Here's what Riyank Arora of Mehta Equities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: RHI Magnesita India(Sell) The stock has experienced a significant breakdown below its recent swing low of Rs 570.55 on weekly charts. With the RSI (relative strength index - 14) hovering near 36.86 on the daily charts. Overall momentum continues to remain weak, and a selling strategy should be applied for the stock. Any pullback towards Rs 570 to Rs 580 zone should be utilized as a selling opportunity on the stock with a set stop-loss of Rs 605, targeting potential levels of Rs 480 and Rs 450.  Rainbow Children's Medicare(Buy) The stock has reached an important support level of Rs 1,100 on its daily charts.

Overall, with the RSI on daily charts nearing 47, up from 33 in the last few trading sessions, momentum is expected to gradually increase on the counter.  Piramal Pharma(Hold) The stock has undergone a significant breakdown below its recent support level of Rs 120 on its daily charts. The overall structure remains positive as per the weekly charts, suggesting a strategy of buying on declines for the stock.

"," The momentum in the Nifty 50 has turned in favour of bears, as evidenced by the consolidation and breakdowns in technical parameters. Buyers need to be cautious near 21,800, as a breakout above this level could lead to further selling pressure towards 21,700 and then to the 21,500 mark. In case of a rebound, 22,000 is expected to be the immediate resistance, with a potential breakout towards 22,000. Stocks that bucked the market trend include RHI Magnesita India, Rainbow Children's Medicare, and Piramal Pharma. Investors should watch for a pullback towards Rs 570 to Rs 580 zone on RHI Magnesita India to consider selling opportunities.

"The Nifty is displaying a robust bullish trend, characterised by consistent higher top higher bottom formations, particularly evident on the monthly charts where it hovers near the all-time high levels. This indicates enduring positive sentiment for the long term. On the weekly charts, the index bounced off significant support at the 13-week EMA (exponential moving average) following a brief correction, resuming its primary uptrend and setting a fresh record high after a three-week period. Additionally, a potential breakout of the cup-and-handle pattern is looming on the daily charts at the life-high level, suggesting an uptick in the bullish momentum. Key technical indicators, notably the relative strength index (RSI), are portraying optimistic readings above 60 across daily, weekly, and monthly time frames, indicating favourable momentum conditions. In terms of levels, immediate resistance is notable at 22,800, a significant level on higher time frames, with further resistance observed at 23,170 and 23,400. Conversely, crucial support levels are identified at 22,300 and 22,000. Considering the current chart patterns, a prolonged bullish phase is anticipated for the longer term. Consequently, it is advisable to seek buying opportunities at the current level, with potential upside targets ranging from 22,800 to 23,170. To mitigate risk effectively, implementing a strict stop-loss strategy at 22,300 on a closing basis is recommended. Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks: Ipca Laboratories: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,276 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,173 | Target: Rs 1,530 | Return: 20 percent Ipca Laboratories shows a robust structural development, characterised by a pattern of higher highs and higher lows since its strong turnaround from May 2023. Particularly noteworthy is its ability to sustain above the 78.60 percent key retracement level of its previous downward move (from Rs 1,371 to Rs 669), indicating potential for further upward momentum. The stock has consistently maintained levels above important moving averages such as the 12-weekly and 26-weekly, affirming a positive trend. Notably, its resilience is evidenced by its rebounds from the 12-weekly EMA, showcasing effective mean reversion dynamics. The RSI study remains above 60 across various timeframes, reinforcing the bullish momentum. When compared against the Nifty on a ratio chart, Ipca Labs continues to display outperformance, suggesting continued strength relative to the broader market index. Going ahead, we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 1,530. The bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 1,173 level.

The RSI study consistently remains above 60 across various timeframes, while both the ADX and +DI lines are above 30, reinforcing the bullish trend strength. Going ahead we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 2,597. The Bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 1,910 level.

"Indian equities have been one of the biggest losers among the top 10 global markets in March, hit by a decline in sentiment towards small and mid-cap stocks. Returns in dollar terms have also been lower because of a depreciation in the rupee. So far in March, India's aggregate market capitalisation dropped by 1.6 percent in dollar terms, marking the steepest fall since October 2023. The Indian equity market, however, maintained its fifth position globally with a market capitalisation of $4.5 trillion. The UK recorded the largest gains of 3.8 percent, followed by Canada and Japan with gains of 3.75 percent and 3.43 percent. The market value for the US and France expanded 2.66 percent and 1.84 percent, while Hong Kong saw a growth of 0.84 percent. Saudi Arabia suffered the sharpest decline of 2.13 percent, followed by India's 1.6 percent and China's 1.4 percent.  The domestic markets went into a correction in March after investors turned nervous about parking their money in midcaps and smallcaps, and liquidity challenges were hardened by operator activity. The recent ED raid on Hari Shankar Tibrewal and others involved in stock manipulation also thickened the air of caution in the broader market. Sebi's advisory to mutual funds regarding froth accumulation in smallcap and midcap schemes further impacted these stocks. On the currency front, the Indian National Rupee weakened around 0.6 percent against the US dollar in March. The markets, however, rebounded last week following a more dovish stance than expected from the US Federal Reserve, driving global indices to record highs and benefiting stocks. US Fed decided to maintain the interest rates aligned with market expectations. The decision was unanimous, reflecting the consensus among participants who see no immediate need for rate hikes. Highlights from the US central bank included a dovish outlook for the coming year, with the Fed retaining the projected three rate cuts for the year despite a strong labour market. Fed chair Jerome Powell noted a considerable easing of inflation but emphasised the need for a more sustainable slowdown in prices. After the recent spate of corrections, analysts foresee a base forming in indices. Many quality companies have hit key support levels. Investors should prioritise accumulating quality stocks for the long term. The ongoing consolidation is expected to pave the way for the next upward movement, with largecaps likely to outperform the broader market, analysts said. Emkay Research in its latest report said March correction offers a 6-12-month entry opportunity, driven by stretched valuations and small and midcap liquidity concerns. Despite the wobble, the economic fundamentals remained strong for India, with earnings growth continuing in FY25. Emkay Research expects a rebound in 3-6 months as smallcaps and midcaps outperform and largecap trade unwinds. Valuations remain mixed, with Nifty P/E moderate at 20x but small and midcap indices elevated at 29x and 25x. Small and midcaps rally persists due to economic shift towards manufacturing, offering volatile yet rewarding opportunities, said the brokerage. Emkay had in its January report said the Nifty would hit 24,000 by the end of December 2024. In its latest report it preferred smallcaps and midcaps and overweighting consumer discretionary, materials, and industrials. The brokerage bases its three-six-month projection on factors like anticipated BJP victory in the general elections next month, a reform-oriented budget in July, and monetary easing by the Reserve Bank of India. Foreign brokerage Jefferies said it sees the recent decline in midcaps and smallcaps as just a correction, and not a meltdown like 2018. Despite potential further corrections due to increased volumes and mutual fund flows, it views this as healthy. It remains bullish on sectors like property development, industrial and power, and select PSUs. Unlike 2018, this correction isn't worsened by a crisis, and macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong. Inflows to smallcaps and midcaps have moderated, though volumes remained high, signalling potential for further correction, it said.

Overall demand trends in Q4 were largely similar to Q3, with marginal improvement in rural demand on a two-year basis, but year-on-year trends were still sluggish, Nuvama said in the report dated March 28. Growth in the urban markets, according to the analysts, continued to drive growth, led by a demand for premium products. Negative price growth ""Negative price growth is likely to continue in Q4FY24 for companies such asHindustan Unilever,Britannia,Marico, andPidiliteas well as paint companies similar to Q3 due to passing on of gross margin expansion,"" the brokerage estimated.

The parliamentary elections in April-June may create a temporary surge indemand, with incremental sales of 6-8 percent in Q1 of FY25 for small packs of snacks and biscuits, according to Nuvama.

""This shall be potentially positive for rural consumption, which is currently under stress for staples companies.

"Motilal Oswal's research report onVarun Beverages Varun Beverages (VBL) experienced a sustained period (CY19-23) of robust revenue growth momentum (with a revenue/sales volume CAGR of ~22%/17%), aided by the company’s expansion into new geographical markets, the diversification of product portfolio, strengthening of the distribution network, efficient manufacturing capabilities, and a favorable demand environment. To sustain the growth momentum, VBL has adopted a multi-pronged strategy for CY24, wherein it will focus on enhancing its manufacturing capability (to rise ~45% over CY22 capacity; and the capacity for dairy and juices set to triple), bolstering its distribution network (~3.8m retail outlets in CY23 vs. ~3m in CY22), and improving its geographical reach (domestically as well as internationally).

The index also slipped below the 50 DMA (day moving average), with several of its constituents nearing 52-week lows.

Meanwhile, Bank Nifty has seen seven red consecutive trading sessions and is just holding above 100 DMA. Private banking stocks are struggling to provide support while the Nifty PSU Index weakens on the weekly chart.

"The week ended April 5 favoured the bulls, but the Nifty traded within a range of 22,300 to 22,600 points, though it managed to end the week with a gain of 0.84 percent. It, however, failed to close above its previous all-time high of 22,526.60, which raises concerns for the current week. The Nifty is trading above the S3 Camarilla pivot (22,346), and it found support at this level in the previous trading session. Additionally, since the Nifty is trading significantly above its 21-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (DEMA), there is a possibility of reversion towards the next support levels of 22,340 and 22,200. Overall, the levels to watch out for on the higher side would be 22,600 - 22,800 and lower side 22,200–22,000. The Nifty Bank index emerged as a notable performer in the past week, gaining almost 1,368 points and closing with a substantial increase of 2.90 percent for the week. Looking ahead, the level of 48,636 poses an immediate resistance as it represents the previous high reached in December 2023. Coincidentally, the 48,600 mark aligns with R5 Camarilla resistance, which could prompt some investors to book profits, potentially leading to a pullback in the Nifty Bank index towards its immediate support levels of 48,000 and 47,500. Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks: Orient Cement: Buy | LTP: Rs 217 | Stop-Loss: Rs 195 | Target: Rs 250 | Return: 15 percent Following a peak near the Rs 293 level, Orient Cement encountered a notable downturn, marked by a sharp decline of 35 percent in its overall value. Despite this downturn, Orient Cement has shown signs of stability around Rs 200 level for the week, establishing a sustained support base. It's noteworthy that Rs 190-200 level coincides with Fibonacci ratio clustering, as indicated in the chart.

"Battery manufacturers likeExide IndustriesandAmara Raja Batterieshave extended gains on April 9, rallying up to 20 percent in the last three sessions on the back of a combination of partnerships, bullish brokerage calls and robust growth prospects. On April 9, Exide Industries' shares advanced over 2 percent, a day after the counter rallied 17 percent higher. This comes after South Korean auto majors Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) and Kia Corporation announced a partnership with the homegrown battery maker for electric vehicle battery localisation in the country. Following the development, JPMorgan has assigned an 'overweight' call on the stock citing that the company's ability to garner partnerships with global OEMs allay investor concerns. Further, more order wins could also be on the cards as Exide continues to be in discussions with several OEMs. Follow our live blog for all the market action The global brokerage has increased the valuation of Exide's EV battery business from Rs 25 per share to Rs 172 per sharegiven the increased confidence post the Kia-Hyundai tie up. Not just that, it has further hiked the target price to Rs 480 from Rs 330. The new price target implies an upside potential of 27.3 percent from Rs 377 last the close of April 9. Similarly, Amara Raja Batteries' share price also spiked about 11 percent in the last three days. ""We expect Amara to continue to outpace the organised lead-acid battery industry, led by client acquisitions, product launches, and benefit from its extensive distribution network,"" said Sharekhan by BNP Paribas in a note. The brokerage further added that the company has strong long-term revenue visibility, given its focus on the aftermarket segment and its investment in Li-ion battery cell manufacturing will drive its long-term growth. The plant is expected to begin deliveries in FY26.

The stock was trading at Rs 890, higher by 2.5 percent on April 9. ""Amara Raja is gearing up to be a leader by undertaking new business opportunities in the battery space, solar, and motive power, and by expanding capacity and network, along with consolidation in existing areas,"" analysts at Motilal Oswal said. However, the declining cost of lithium batteries poses a threat to the Auto and the Industrial Batteries business. E-2Ws/e-3Ws do not require a lead acid battery as an auxiliary battery. This could in turn adversely impact 15-20percent of revenue of lead acid battery players. At 2:20 pm, the Exide Industry shares were up 385, up 2 percent from the previous close.

"The market seems to be in a consolidation phase, with 21,900 acting as a strong immediate support for the Nifty 50, and 22,200 as a key hurdle on the higher side, especially ahead of the FOMC meet outcome due on March 20. Hence, unless and until the index breaks on either side of this range, the directionless trade may continue, experts said, adding the breaking of 21,900 can drag the Nifty 50 down up to 21,500, and decisively climbing above 22,200 can take it towards a record high. On March 18, the benchmark indices showed a smart recovery from the day's low. The Nifty 50 climbed 32 points to 22,056 and formed a small bullish candlestick pattern with upper and lower shadows on the daily charts, indicating volatile trade.

The stock traded above all key moving averages and continued higher highs, higher lows formation for yet another session. Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: Godfrey Phillips In the previous session, prices bounced back on the upside precisely from the trendline which is visible on the below chart. Support as per this comes near Rs 2,910 levels. As long as the price trades above it, further buying can be seen. In the below chart, we have also shown Bollinger Bands, wherein prices reversed from the mid-bands and moved up. So, with follow-up buying, we can expect a move towards upper bands in the coming weeks which is near Rs 3,400 levels. In short, the overall tone for Godfrey Phillips is bullish. A breach above Rs 3,190 is a must for further bullish momentum to continue with the targets of Rs 3,310 followed by Rs 3,400 levels. On the downside, Rs 2,910 is the key support level.  Linde India Linde India has been moving higher recently and intact in a strong uptrend. On the daily chart, the price has closed above Rs 6,765 level which confirms the breakout of the rounding bottom pattern. We have shown the ADX (average directional index) indicator which gives an indication if the stock is trending or in a trading range. The low readings of ADX indicate that the stock is in a range. The ADX of this stock is 35.02 giving an indication of a trending market. A reading above 25 means strong directional strength. In short, the trend for this stock is positive. Use dips towards Rs 6,680-6,730 as a buying opportunity for a move towards Rs 7,400-7,500 levels as long as Rs 6,350 holds on the downside.  PI Industries In the below chart, we can see that the stock reversed from the important support which was near Rs 3,715 levels. After which prices crossed above the EMA (exponential moving average) trend cloud indicator, and since then prices managed to sustain above it.

In the previous session, prices gave the break-out of the consolidation and also closed well above the consolidation range which is a positive sign. In short, the trend for PI Industries is positive. A break above Rs 3,770 is a must for fresh buying to emerge with the targets of Rs 3,890 followed by Rs 3,930 levels, as long as Rs 3,600 holds on the downside.

"Small- and mid-cap indices summarily beat frontline indices in FY24, giving more than double the returns ofNifty 50. However, equity analysts expect the trend to reverse going into the next financial year 2024-25 as large-cap stocks may reclaim momentum, while Sebi's concerns of 'frothy' valuations and mutual funds' stress test results cast a shadow on small-cap stocks. Indian equity markets had exhibited a stellar performance in FY24, backed by accommodative monetary policy, strong domestic retail participation, corporate earnings, and economic recovery post pandemic blues. From 16,900 to 22,500, benchmark Nifty 50 climbed over 27 percent in FY24, while Sensex surged over 23 percent. Market experts expect the bull trend in large cap stocks to remain intact going ahead even as some uncertainty owing to 2024 general elections may worry investors. Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice-President of Technical Research at Religare Broking, expects Nifty to surge up to 25,500 in financial year 2024-25 (FY25) supported by heavyweight stocks. However, on the downside, he underlined a strong support of 19,500-20,000 for Nifty.  Broader markets widely outperform Nifty, Sensex On the broader-end of markets, the Nifty Smallcap 100 and Nifty Midcap 100 indices have outperformed benchmarks by rising 69 percent and 59 percent, respectively in FY24. But experts believe that this trend would change going forward, given market regulator Sebi's concerns on 'frothy' valuations in these segments and mutual funds stress test results. ""Smallcaps, especially, are likely to receive a backlash in FY25 as Sebi may ramp up scrutiny over this segment due to stretched valuations. We expect smallcaps and smaller midcaps to see moderation in gains going ahead,"" warned VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist of Geojit Financial Services. Where to invest for FY25 Sectorally, Nifty Realty index was the top winner in FY24 as it gave triple-digit returns (131 percent), followed by Nifty India Defence, Nifty PSE, Nifty CPSE, and Nifty PSU Bank indices.  For FY25, Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services expects Nifty PSU Bank index to take the lead, while the realty stocks could see some moderation as most positives are already priced-in. On the flipside, Nifty Media, Nifty Private Bank, and Bank Nifty were among the top sectors that saw modest gains in FY24.  As an investment formula, analysts are advising investors to churn their portfolio towards large-caps and large mid-caps as volatility is likely to rise due to 2024 general elections and uncertainity in banks' monetary policy path. ""We expect heavyweight stocks like Reliance Industries, L&T, and top banking names to take the lead going ahead,"" said Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services.

Traders may consider adopting a buy-on-dip strategy, with 46000 as a stop-loss level.

"March saw a notable decline in daily volumes in both cash and derivative segments of stock exchanges, thanks to a heightened volatility in the equity market. The average daily turnover in the equity cash segment of the BSE and the NSE dropped 13.33 percent, the most since October 2023, to Rs 1.12 lakh crore. Similarly, the average daily turnover for derivatives decreased by 8.76 percent to Rs 373.44 lakh crore, marking the sharpest fall since April 2021, from Rs 409.27 lakh crore in February.   ""Average turnover in the cash segment in March fell compared to February due to the correction in the overall market from the second week of March and even sharper correction across the small and midcaps. The average turnover in derivatives fell as apart from the above reason, bounce in the third week of March was patchy among the F&O stocks. Also year-end considerations meant that the overall positions were reduced during the course of the month,"" said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities. Indian markets saw a downturn due to concerns over mid and small cap stock valuations raised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, dampening investor sentiment and reducing participation in mid and small cap stocks, analysts said. In March, the Sensex and the Nifty gained 1.6 percent each, while the BSE Smallcap and the BSE Midcap indices fell 0.6 percent and 4.55 percent. Shrey Jain, founder and chief executive of SAS Online - India's Deep Discount Broker, believes that the investor participation should improve going forward. The S&P500 index hitting a new lifetime high in the US will have a positive effect on Indian equities as well. Foreign portfolio investors have exhibited keen interest in Indian equities in March. If the money flows continue, then it will be supportive for stock prices, Jain added. Last week, markets surged on a more dovish stance from the US Federal Reserve, driving global indices to record highs and boosting stocks. The Fed's decision to maintain interest rates met market expectations unanimously, signalling no immediate need for rate hikes. Despite a robust labour market, the Fed retained its projected three rate cuts for the year, emphasising the importance of a sustainable slowdown in inflation. Several analysts anticipate a base forming in indices after recent corrections, with quality companies hitting key support levels. They recommend accumulating quality stocks for the long term, foreseeing ongoing consolidation paving the way for the next upward movement, particularly in largecaps. Analysts further said that in the run up to the elections, the Nifty50 index should remain in a narrow range with an upward bias. If the Nifty crosses the previous life high of 22,526, then it should touch 22,800 where it may face some resistance. Outcome of the monetary policy review by the Reserve Bank of India will be watched keenly to take cues about liquidity management and impending cuts in policy interest rates. Traders should focus on largecap stocks and maintain stop loss, they added. Nuvama Research advises turning bullish after the recent spate of corrections in midcaps and smallcaps, seeing it as part of an ongoing bull market. They suggest taking long positions, noting oversold conditions at key support levels. With the broader market cooling down and largecaps experiencing corrective phases without any major impact on Nifty50, they anticipate a favourable risk premium for long positions, buoyed by strong global market trends, upcoming earnings seasons, and impending general elections.

"Indian markets are likely to rise on March 21, tracking gains in the US and Asian markets after the Federal Reserve kept the borrowing costs unchanged and stoked expectations of as many as three rate cuts this year. Trends in the GIFT Nifty indicate a strong start for the broader index in India, with a gain of 146 points or 0.67 percent. The Nifty futures were trading around the 22,071 level.

Investors cheered the Fed commentary pushing all the major Wall Street indices to close at fresh record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 401.37 points, or 1.03 percent, to 39,512.13, the S&P 500 gained 46.11 points, or 0.89 percent, to 5,224.62 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 202.62 points, or 1.25 percent, to 16,369.41.

"The Nifty closed at 22,327 with a respectable gain of over a percent for the week ended March 28. A bullish sentiment prevailed on the market throughout the week, reflecting an overall improvement in the broader market mood. The correction observed in mid-March appears to have concluded, with prices closing above the key resistance levels, signalling a resumption of the primary uptrend. Additionally, the RSI Smoothened indicator that recently witnessed a dip has turned northward and hints at a fresh 'buy' call. Going ahead to the week starting April 1, close attention will be paid to the all-time high levels above 22,500, as hesitation was evident at these levels. A sustained trade or close above this point would confirm the resumption of the primary uptrend, potentially triggering a further rally in April. Conversely, buying on dips remained a notable pattern during the week, suggesting that 22,200 serves as an immediate support, while 22,000 and 21,700 represent subsequent key support levels. Notably, 22,500 and then 22,680 stand as significant hurdles on the upside. Traders are advised to monitor these levels closely and adjust their strategies accordingly. While midcap and small-cap sectors showed improvement during the truncated week, the primary contribution came from heavyweight stocks. Going ahead, although the uptrend may continue, traders must exercise selectivity in their approach, as index management is anticipated. Here are two buy calls for the short term: ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 609 | Stop-Loss: Rs 579 | Target: Rs 670 | Return: 10 percent Over the past two years, stock prices have consistently encountered substantial resistance around Rs 600 level. However, they have now decisively breached this barrier, confirming a robust breakout known as the 'Inverse Head and Shoulders' pattern. This breakout, evident on the weekly chart, is accompanied by a notable increase in trading volume and the presence of strong bullish candlesticks. Furthermore, the daily chart indicates a compelling moving average crossover, with the 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) surpassing the 200-day SMA (simple moving average) from below. Taking into account these technical parameters, we hold a firmly bullish outlook on this stock. Hence, we recommend buying ICICI Prudential at around Rs 609 - 600, with a stop-loss of Rs 579 and target of Rs 670.  Piramal Pharma: Buy | LTP: Rs 129 | Stop-Loss: Rs 123 | Target: Rs 138 | Return: 7 percent Following a robust surge from Rs 88 to Rs 149, the stock experienced a healthy correction over the past few months. However, after retracing approximately 50 percent of this rally, prices have begun to exhibit positive momentum once again. Notably, the recent correction occurred on low volumes, while upticks have been accompanied by comparatively higher volumes, indicating accumulation in this stock. Moreover, prices have closed above the 20, 50, and 89 EMA on a single daily candle, a rare and strong bullish signal. Additionally, the momentum oscillator RSI (relative strength index) has recently issued a buy signal in the oversold zone, further supporting the bullish outlook. Considering all these factors, we maintain a positive stance on the stock. Hence, we recommend buying Piramal Pharma at around Rs 129 - 127, with a stop-loss of Rs 123 and target of Rs 138.

"The Nifty 50 had a strong finish for the monthly F&O expiry session, climbing above the falling resistance trendline from record-high levels. This has raised hopes for a promising start to the April series, which begins on Monday, April 1. As long as the index remains above 22,300, experts predict that it is likely to reach a new record high in the coming days. The key support level to watch out for is 22,000. On March 28, the Nifty 50 rose by 203 points to reach 22,327, and the BSE Sensex gained 655 points, with the broader markets underperforming the benchmark indices.

A strong debt-free balance-sheet, high RoE and its imminent entry into the ‘INR 10bn-plus EBITDA club’ make for a compelling investment case. We recommend BUY with an INR 271 TP, valued at 11x FY26E EV/EBITDA. Outlook Star is set to surpass the INR 10bn-plus EBITDA milestone in FY26E, complimented by: 1) expected cost savings of ~INR 150/t, owing to the slated jump in share of green power and increase in FSA coal allocation; 2) a strong balance-sheet with net cash of ~INR 8bn in FY26E (vs. ~INR 5bn in FY23) despite capex; and 3) firm RoE of ~18% over FY25-FY26.

Realty and Energy were the top performers on a sector-wise performance while PSU Banks and IT were the laggards. A mixed trend was seen in the broader markets where Midcaps underperformed while Smallcap gained over 0.90% and outshined Nifty50. As indicated yesterday, the Index has formed an Inverted Head & Shoulder formation and now awaiting a breakout for the target of 22,640 while on the lower side, 21,900 will continue to act as a strong support. Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas The Nifty opened gap up and continued to inch higher throughout the day to close with gains of ~119 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty is inching towards 22200 – 22215 where multiple resistance parameters are placed. We believe that the retracement rally has more steam left and we expect the momentum to continue. Daily and hourly momentum indicator is providing divergent signals which can lead to a consolidation and hence in case of a dip towards 22100 – 22060 it should be used as a buying opportunity for target of 22215 - 22250. Bank Nifty is consolidating within the range of 46500 – 47000 since last four trading sessions. A breach of this range shall lead to trending moves in that direction. We expect it to break out on the upside and expect levels of 47270 – 47300 from short term perspective and hence one can go long with a stoploss of 46530.

"Oil marketing companies (OMCs), which have so far weathered the impact of rising crude prices, may come under pressure in the near term if crude keeps rising, experts have said. Crude price touched a four-month high amid Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries and OPEC supply cuts and is nearing $87 a barrel. Lower crude exports from Iraq, Saudi Arabia and signs of stronger demand and economic growth in China and the US has also pushed crude prices higher. These Russian outages and extended OPEC+ output cuts have pushed Morgan Stanley to raise its Brent oil price forecasts by $10 to $90 for the third quarter of 2024. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Rising prices may strain OMCs like Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) as they face higher costs in sourcing crude for refining into petrol and diesel. As crude prices surge, OMCs may find it challenging to fully pass on the cost hikes to consumers, given government regulations or market competition. The government’s recent decision to slash petrol and diesel prices by Rs 2 a litre, combined with escalating crude prices could further squeeze OMCs' profit margins. Motilal Oswal expects a negative stock price reaction for OMCs in the near term, given the retail price cut and recent elevated Brent crude prices. The brokerage has a “buy” rating on HPCL and IOCL and a “neutral” call on BPCL. As the impact of the Red Sea crisis on crude oil and refining GRMs wanes, marketing margins can recover to above Rs 3, the brokerage said. Morgan Stanley said the auto fuel price cut should finally remove key overhang. The brokerage prefers Indian Oil, which has the highest refining exposure. ""HPCL may see a negative near-term impact on integrated margins and one should look to accumulate the stock on corrections,"" Morgan Stanley said. On the contrary, CLSA has a “sell” call on all three leading OMCs-HPCL, BPCL and IOC. ""Margin on diesel is now below fair levels and this cut challenges the optimistic narrative of the government. Stock price baking in much higher than long-term average refining and marketing margins,"" it added.

A rise in the price of crude can mean narrower profit margins. Upstream oil exploration firms like ONGC benefit from higher crude prices. Oil drilling companies might also find their services in greater demand, sometimes even commanding premium rates.

"Bank Nifty was trading higher in the afternoon on April 3, making a smart recovery from morning lows. According to experts, a muted expiry is expected in the 47,200-47,800 range. The ""buy on dips"" strategy would work as long as the 12-stock index closes above 47,000, they said.  Bars in red indicate the change in open interest (OI) of call writers, while the green show the change in OI of put writers The options data suggests that put writers are dominant at 47,200 and 47,000 strike. Sameet Chavan, Technical Analyst at Angel One, said, ""As of now, we are expecting a muted expiry session for Bank Nifty. The range to be watched would be 47,700-47,300.

"With a 5 percent gain on a year-to-date basis, the Nifty MNC index is trading at its all-time highs and has emerged as one of the top performers by easily beating the Nifty returns of 1.63 percent. Only infrastructure, realty, healthcare and commodity indices are ahead of Nifty MNC index so far in 2024. When we look at the composition of the Nifty MNC index, we find that after the FMCG sector which has a total weightage of over 31.5 percent in the index, it is the capital goods sector that constitutes over 21.5 percent weightage of the index. Also read:Investors get the whiff of higher value in high dividend yielding small-cap stocks Capital goods constituents of Nifty MNC index such as Bosch, Cummins India, Siemens and ABB have contributed handsomely to the gains of the Nifty MNC index so far this year.  Cummins India, which carries a weightage of 2.74 percent in the Nifty MNC index, is up nearly 50 percent on a year-to-date basis, underperforming only the top index gainer Oracle Financials, which surged 99 percent in the same period. Bosch, with a weightage of 3.16 percent in the index, is up around 36 percent, ABB India 27 percent with 4.49 percent weightage in the index, and Siemens with weightage of 6.3 percent is up by 24 percent. Another common feature that links these capital goods multinational stocks is that they are almost zero-debt companies. We find that the debt-free capital goods MNCs have largely outperformed the Nifty returns.  Capital goods outperformance The capital goods sector has been doing well because of the various government initiatives towards incremental capex spending. The chart below explains the outperformance of BSE Capital Goods Index over BSE Sensex in the previous five years. The BSE Capital Goods index has delivered almost double the returns of the BSE Sensex in this period.  Also read:Bajaj Auto turns the Hero of Nifty pack over last one year for consistencyExperts take on capital goods sector The important question from the investor’s point of view is whether the growth is behind the capital goods sector or the momentum is not over yet. Anand Rathi believes that private capex will drive the next leg of growth for the capital goods sector. The brokerage house in its research report published on March 22, picked Cummins for a 'buy' tag, while Siemens and ABB enjoy a 'hold' status. The brokerage house is bullish on the power generation business of Cummins India because of its superior technology and reach that outsmart its peers. The report highlights that the demand is robust in data centres, commercial and residential realty, infrastructure and manufacturing, allowing it to build in a 23 percent CAGR expectation over FY23-26 for its powergen business. On Siemens, Anand Rathi believes the company is a key beneficiary of the many macro themes currently unfolding in India. These include digitisation, sustainability, infra upgrade and modernisation. ABB, according to the brokerage firm, like Siemens, is a key beneficiary of the unfolding macro themes and ongoing capex. ABB’s strength lies in electrification and automation and hence the stock carries a 'hold' recommendation. Given the underlying strength of the capital goods sector in India and the high quality of the MNC businesses, debt-free multinationals will be on long-term watch lists of investors.

"Considering the consistent uptrend in the Nifty and scaling of a new record high by the benchmark, followed by the formation of a Doji candlestick pattern at the high, which generally acts as a trend reversal, small-time profit-booking can't be ruled out in the market in the coming sessions.

"India has beaten rest of the Asian markets by attracting the highest foreign funds flow in March, defying geopolitical crises and concerns that the higher interest rate regime will continue for some more time. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) pumped $3.63 billion into Indian equities in their biggest buying binge since December 2023. Domestic institutions continued to be net buyers, investing around Rs 52,467 crore in the market to hit a four-year high.  Outside India, South Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia were the investment destinations for FIIs, while they chose to pull out money from markets in Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. South Korea received inflows of $2.91 billion, Taiwan $1.14 billion and Indonesia $585 million. The Japanese market recorded the biggest FII outflow of $5.35 billion, followed by Thailand and Malaysia at $1.13 billion and $514 million. In Vietnam, the outflow reached $197 million, and $40 million in the Philippines. Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities, attributed the net FII figures to purchases of stocks through block deals and index rebalancing in March. A steep correction in the market also threw up an opportunity to buy undervalued stocks, including small and mid-caps. For DIIs, cash reserves helped raise their equity holdings. With March being the year-end month, investors try to book fresh positions and clean up their books. This also fuelled the buying binge, according to him. March witnessed significant block trades, including BAT Plc selling its stake in ITC for Rs 17,485 crore, Rakesh Gangwal divesting in Interglobe Aviation for over Rs 7,800 crore, Tata Sons selling off around 1 percent stake in Tata Consultancy Services for Rs 9,000 crore, and Singtel diluting its stake in Bharti Airtel for Rs 5,849 crore. Gaurav Misra, Head - Equity at Mirae Asset Investment Managers, said Domestic institutions have been buyers and FIIs sellers in aggregate, except for MSCI-related rebalancing. Domestic mutual funds and possibly AIF have been sitting on cash which would have been deployed in stocks where they have bottom-up comfort. This is despite some cohorts of the market being at a premium.  So far in March, the benchmark Sensex and Nifty indices lost 0.1 percent each, while BSE MidCap and SmallCap declined 0.7 percent and 5.53 percent. The correction in the Indian markets were triggered by factors such as ED raids on a major market player, Sebi warning about market froth, concerns about liquidity stress tests by mutual funds, and fears of RBI intervention against stock market inflows. Analysts said that despite the buying binge of the institutional investors, liquidity has dried up after recent actions by the RBI and enforcement agencies, impacting market operators and HNIs reliant on leverage. They added that NBFCs were reassessing lending against shares, reducing the overdraft facilities for HNIs. This forced liquidation of positions, triggering a cycle of falling prices and panic selling. However, analysts expect mutual fund SIP flows are expected to remain stable, and attractive valuations may draw in investors waiting on the sidelines. Stocks linked to dubious entities might take longer to recover, while fundamentally sound ones may rebound more swiftly, they added. Brokerage Nuvama Research in its latest report suggests turning bullish after the recent correction in mid and small-cap stocks. They view the current phase as a correction within an ongoing bull market, reaching oversold conditions at key support levels, recommending long positions. The broader market, previously overheated, has undergone a healthy decline, likely marking the end of the correction phase and the resumption of the bull market. Large caps have also experienced corrective phases without significant damage to the Nifty50. Strong global market tailwinds, upcoming earnings seasons, and general elections indicate favorable risk premiums for long positions in the market, it added.

Taking Stock: Sensex, Nifty hit new highs on Day 1 of FY25; realty, metals shine The BSE midcap index rose 1.6 percent and the smallcap gained nearly 3 percent... Read More Markets were in an upbeat mood after a prolonged holiday session last week as both Sensex & Nifty propelled to fresh highs on the back of bargain hunting, which shows that appetite for equity assets continue to remain strong for investors despite hiccups at regular intervals. Although there are challenges related to delayed rate cuts and uncertainty surrounding geo-political tensions, India's strong reform path and expectations that the ruling party could come back to power in the upcoming general elections has been prompting investors to take bullish bets. Following today's record high levels, Nifty faces resistance between 22601-22750 zone while the index has support at 22201-22000 levels. The onset of the new financial year saw a robust start in the markets, with the Sensex surging and closing 363 points higher at 74,014.55, while the Nifty climbed above 22,462. This positive trajectory was fueled by strong global market performance. All sectoral indices saw gains, especially in the metals sector. Additionally, the BSE midcap index witnessed a rise of 1.6%, and the smallcap index boasted an impressive gain of nearly 3%. The prevailing sentiment in the market remains bullish, with evident momentum aiming for the Nifty to reach 22,700. In light of this optimistic outlook, market participants are advised to maintain a strategy of ""buy on dips"". The Nifty opened at gap up and traded with a narrow range thereafter. It registered a new all-time high of 22529.95. The Nifty has been witnessing a sharp upmove since past couple of trading sessions and we expect the momentum to continue. The hourly momentum indicator has triggered a negative crossover which can lead to a consolidation and a dip towards 22400 – 22350 is possible, however it should be used as a buying opportunity as the overall trend appears positive. If Nifty manages to sustain above 22500 then there shall be a further upside till 22670 – 22740. Bank Nifty has broken out of the sideways consolidation on the way up and is witnessing follow through buying interest. It is likely to continue the momentum towards 47850 – 48000 from a short-term perspective. So the minor degree pullbacks should be used as a buying opportunity. The Indian market boarded on a strong trajectory at the onset of the new financial year, with indications pointing towards a continuation of this favourable momentum, in the near term. This confidence is supported by a global rally in expectation of a Fed rate cut in June and a healthy domestic earnings growth forecast in Q4FY24. Notably, metal stocks excelled today, owing to the swift pace of Chinese PMI data, indicating traction in the economic recovery. Going ahead, RBI monetary policy, India PMI data, and US non-farm payroll data will set the direction of the market. The Nifty index encountered a sideways trading session following a robust start, encountering resistance at 22500, coinciding with the highest open interest on the call side. To maintain the upward momentum, the index must decisively breach the 22500 mark, paving the way for further gains towards 22700/22800 levels. On the downside, support is situated at 22350, and as long as the index holds above this level, the overall outlook remains optimistic. The Bank Nifty index displayed upward movement leading up to the crucial RBI policy session this week, surpassing the immediate hurdle at 47500. With lower-end support around the 47000-46800 zone, any retracement towards this level presents a favorable opportunity for long positions. The next obstacle for the BankNifty is at 48000. Post the RBI policy announcement, market direction and sentiment are expected to become clearer. Market started the week with modest gains and hit new life highs, gaining over half a percent. After the gap-up opening, Nifty traded lackluster in the narrow range and finally closed around the opening range at 22462 levels. On the sectoral front, realty and metal performed well while FMCG and Auto traded subdued. The broader indices outperformed the benchmark, wherein smallcap gained over three percent while midcap closed higher by one and a half percent. We are now eyeing 22,700 in Nifty thus participants should maintain a “buy on dips” approach. We feel the participation of the banking pack would continue to play a critical role in maintaining the prevailing momentum, while others may play a supportive role on a rotational basis. Traders should maintain a stock-specific approach and focus on the stocks which are showing higher relative strength. The markets started the new financial year on a robust note and were seen compounding their gains before selected heavyweights dragged the Index marginally lower to settle the session at 22,462 with gains of 135.10 points. Media and Realty were the top performers sector-wise followed by Metal while Auto and FMCG ended the day with minuscule losses. The interest of market participants was more towards the Broader markets as Mid and Smallcaps gained by 1.74% & 3.26% and outshined the Nifty50. On the daily chart, the Index has made a DOJI candlestick pattern at record levels indicating indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. To extend the underlying bull run, the Index must breach the stiff hurdle of 22,500 while the downside is guarded at 22,270.  : Market ended higher for the third consecutive session on April 1 with Nifty around 22,450. At close, the Sensex was up 363.20 points or 0.49 percent at 74,014.55, and the Nifty was up 135.10 points or 0.61 percent at 22,462.00. About 3015 shares advanced, 572 shares declined, and 112 shares unchanged. Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Adani Ports, Shriram Finance and Divis Labs are among the top gainers on the Nifty, while losers are Eicher Motors, Titan Company, Bajaj Auto, LTIMindtree and Nestle.

"Shares ofTata Motors Limitedadvanced 1.3 percent to Rs 1,026, extending gains on April 9 after its British luxury arm Jaguar Land Rover's fourth quarter retail sales grew 11 percent on-year to 114,038 units, surpassing expectations. Analysts, however, remained cautious about margins due to the product mix. The surge in JLR sales has been attributed to heightened production levels and consistent global demand. Retail sales grew 32 percent in the UK, 21 percent in North America and 16 percent internationally from the year-ago period. Sales in China, one of JLR's biggest markets, however, declined 9 percent and a 2 percent in Europe, the country's largest EV player said in a business update. Follow our live blog for all the market action For the March quarter, wholesale volumes reached 110,190 vehicles, a 16 percent growth from the year-ago period. Should you buy, sell or hold? Macquarie has assigned an ""outperform"" call on the stock with a price target of Rs 1,028 a share. The stock has already breached Macquarie's target with an all-time high of Rs 1,065. The brokerage said JLR's performance in Q4 FY24 slightly exceeded expectations in terms of wholesale figures. The EBITDA margin, however, might remain flat quarter-on-quarter when results are released due to a 100 basis points decrease in the share of premium models and higher incentive spending. Morgan Stanley is also bullish on the counter with an ""overweight"" call and a price target of Rs 1,013. Its analysts said that the mix was weaker as they sold fewer of their premium models. They expect JLR's profit margin to be around 9.1 percent during the quarter, better than the previous quarter's 8.8 percent. Nomura also has a ""buy"" call and a target price of Rs 1,057. This implies an upside of over 4 percent from the last close of Rs 1,013. Nomura estimates that JLR will have a free cash flow (FCF) of GBP 600-700 million in the last quarter, which should help them reduce their net debt to less than GBP 1 billion. At 9.20 am, the stock was trading at Rs 1,029 on the National Stock Exchange, up 1.6 percent from the previous close. Tata Motors' stock has rallied over 28 percent in the last three months.

"After the recent sell-off in broader markets, several small cap stocks are seen stabilising with few outperforming the markets by a good margin. BSE Smallcap index is up by 4.13 percent since March 13 lows while the benchmark BSE Sensex is trading flat in the similar timeframe. The market sell-off in March has ensured that even high dividend paying small cap stocks have fallen sharply. These dividend paying small-cap stocks are seen stabilising and gaining ground in line with the broader market sentiment. Accumulation is seen in select small cap stocks with high dividend yields according to Darpan Patil, of Rupic Consultancy. He adds that the BSE Smallcap Index is testing the demand zone and a minor reversal in trend can be expected. BSE Smallcap index Gulf Oil Lubricantshares were up by more than five percent,Allcargo Logisticsshares gained by more than two percent whileBanco Productsshares strengthened by more than one percent on March 21 trading session.  All these smallcap stocks are high dividend yielding stocks. Purvesh Shelatkar, head of institutional broking at Monarch Networth Capital, says: “Every deep market correction invites smart opportunistic buyers in a bull market. Such deep cuts should be used to add stocks with positive cash flows and dividend paying companies. Same logic can be applied to high quality smallcap companies.” We find several high dividend paying stocks have corrected up to 13 percent in the past one month. The recent correction has improved the dividend yield and hence can be on radar of long-term investors seeking value in dividends as the intrinsic value increases post correction.  Purvesh points out that the earnings growth for FY25-26 is expected to be better for smallcaps than for large caps and hence the interest in small caps, especially on corrections, will remain high. PE levels for the broader indices haven’t moved much due to earnings growth in the past two years, he adds. Recent strategy report by ICICI Securities highlighted how relatively higher weightage to capex-related sectors and engineering sector of the broader market indices places it better in terms of expected earnings growth when compared to Nifty. Also read:PAT to GDP ratio of smallcaps at 0.7% of GDP has more room for expansion: ICICI Securities Darpan believes in such market situation, where the broader markets are cheaper today than they were at the beginning of the year, investors may find value in dividend paying high quality small cap stocks.

"Motilal Oswal's research report onCyient DLM CyientDL is a well-integrated EMS solution provider, deriving majority of its revenue (69% in 9MFY24) from the high-margin and critical end-user industry of Aerospace and Defence (A&D). The global A&D space is poised to grow at a healthy pace (5.9% CAGR over CY22- 26), led by technological advancements, rising defence spending, and the emergence of new markets such as space exploration. This is, in turn, translating into higher growth for the A&D EMS industry, led by the growing trend of outsourcing, which provides cost savings and access to advanced technologies. CyientDL is better placed to grab the growing EMS opportunity in this space, leveraging its strong client relation and multi-decade experience in the A&D sector (both domestic and exports). The India defence sector is under prime focus with defence spending rising steadily, hitting INR6.22t in FY24B, up 4.7% from FY23A. The government targets USD25b in defence manufacturing by CY25, including USD5b from exports. Initiatives such as the Defence Offset Policy are geared toward reducing reliance on foreign arms imports. As of Mar’22, a total of 57 contracts have been signed under this policy, amounting to USD13.5b. Outlook We estimate CyientDL to report a CAGR of 39%/42%/79% in revenue/EBITDA/ Adj.

"HDFC Life, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Max Financial Services and SBI Life gained up to 5 percent on March 26 intra-day deals after the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) left surrender values for non-linked and linked policies unchanged. Brokerages see the status quo as a huge relief for life insurers and expects them to maintain profitability, without any major pressure on margins. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities reiterated a ""buy"" call on all listed life players, betting on their inexpensive valuations as the big uncertainty over surrender penalty is behind. ""The current market prices imply long-term premium growth of 3-7 percent for private life insurers.  Max Life is best placed at the current juncture, SBI Life remains a steady ship,"" they said. Life insurers had raised concerns about IRDAI's December 2023 proposal, which suggested introduction of threshold premiums and higher surrender values for endowment policies. Surrender value is the amount paid by the insurance company to the policyholder upon terminating the policy before the maturity date. ALSO READ:IRDAI’s status quo on surrender charges a relief for insurers, but setback for policyholders The move would have led to around 75 percent decline in surrender profits of non-par products and 140-200 basis points (bps) impact on private life insurers' margins, analysts at Kotak said. Under the final IRDAI guidelines, which will take effect from April 1, the surrender values for life insurance policies are expected to largely remain the same or even lower if policies are surrendered within a period of three years. For life insurance policies surrendered between fourth to seventh year, surrender value may see a minor increase. Analysts at Emkay Global, too, expect listed life insurers to grow in teens and maintain their margins in the mid-20s. Without this development, life insurers would have struggled to handle higher surrender charges for customers who let their policies lapse, they said. They would also have to face the challenge of providing benefits to policyholders who keep their policies active, keeping profitability in mind. ""We maintain our positive view on listed life insurers, backed by their franchise strength and favourable valuation. We prefer ICICI Prudential, Max Financial, and SBI Life from the pack,"" Emkay Global analysts said. On other hand, global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley expects HDFC Life to perform better in the near-term. ""The final surrender value norms seem manageable given they are largely unchanged versus existing norms,"" they said.

Taking Stock: Sensex, Nifty reverse losses to close higher ahead of Fed outcome Top Nifty gainers were Eicher Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Power Grid Corporation, Nestle India and ONGC, while losers were Tata Steel, Tata Consumer Products, Tata Motors, Axis Bank and Cipla... Read More Markets traded volatile and ended almost unchanged, taking a breather after Tuesday’s decline. After the initial uptick, it resumed decline in no time however recovery in select heavyweights pared losses as the session progressed. On the sectoral front, a mixed trend continued wherein energy, FMCG and realty edged higher while metal and financials ended in the red. We may see a breather after the recent fall but the tone is likely to remain negative. Participants should continue with the “sell on rise” approach until Nifty decisively reclaims 22,100 level. Also, we reiterate our preference for index majors over others and avoid adding to the loss making positions. The index remained volatile ahead of the Fed's policy meeting. The overall sentiment remains negative as the index closed below the previous consolidation low. Additionally, the index ended the session below the critical moving average. However, a further fall is anticipated below the recent swing low on the hourly chart, which is positioned around 21700. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 21900-22000. Markets displayed range-bound trend and ended marginally higher as caution prevailed ahead of the US Fed meet outcome on interest rate. While there will be little chance of rate tinkering, the Fed's commentary on inflation and its take on interest rate will be keenly watched. Rising oil prices and currency losing momentum in the last few days could fuel more volatility in the near term. The Nifty witnessed an extremely volatile day of trade today. It opened with gains however was unable to sustain and sold off. Intraday it witnessed a sharp pullback from 21710 levels and closed the day marginally in the green up ~22 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty has taken support around the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the previous rise from 21530 – 22526. The momentum set up on the hourly time frame suggests exhaustion of selling pressure as there are signs of a positive divergence and is currently having a positive crossover. In terms of price pattern, the daily candle has taken form of a Doji pattern which suggests indecision among market participants regarding the direction as both bulls and bears are trying hard to defend their respective boundaries. This could lead to consolidation and the range could be 21700 – 22000. Bank Nifty closed the day on a negative note for the Ninth consecutive trading session. The fall has found support at the lower end of the rising channel and daily lower Bollinger band placed at 45800. The hourly momentum indicator has a positive crossover which is a buy signal. Thus, we can expect a recovery to 46800 – 46950 over the next few trading sessions. On March 20, Indian benchmark indices closed with marginal gains amidst a volatile session. At the close, the Sensex was up 89.64 points or 0.12 percent at 72,101.69, while the Nifty gained 21.60 points or 0.10 percent, closing at 21,839.10. The Sensex and Nifty ended higher amid volatility ahead of the Fed meeting outcomes. After a flat positive start, the Nifty experienced a dip near the 21,700 level, reaching a low of 21,710.65, then bounced back above 21,900, peaking at 21,930 before closing at 21,855.10. The daily chart showed the formation of a doji candlestick, indicating continued bearish pressure in the market. Technical analysis suggests that the Nifty has broken down daily trend line, hinting at a potential reversal of the uptrend. Furthermore, it has dipped below the critical short-term moving average, signaling weakening momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also displayed a bearish crossover, indicating mounting selling pressure. Key levels to monitor include resistance at 22,000 and support at 21,700. A breach below 21,700 could trigger further correction towards the 21,600 levels. Examination of the Open Interest (OI) data reveals the highest OI on the call side at the 22,000 strike price, followed by the 22,300 strike price. On the put side, the highest OI was observed at the 21,500 strike price. The Bank Nifty encountered another round of volatility, with the ongoing struggle between bulls and bears persisting, particularly ahead of the US Fed meeting. Key support lies within the 46000-45800 zone, and maintaining these levels on a closing basis suggests a continued bullish stance. Immediate resistance is positioned at 47000, coinciding with the 20DMA, and a decisive close above this level could reignite the upward trend, targeting levels around 48000-48500. Lifted by favourable global sentiment and solid direct tax collection, Indian markets rebounded, closing with modest gains. Robust FII & DII inflows sustained the market. As per latest market consensus, the odds of rate cut in June have reduced. The US Fed is likely to delay the cut rate to the latter part of the year due to a resilient economy. Domestic mid & small caps are likely to lag large caps driven by premium valuations, in the short-term.

On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty is in the process of cooling off after the sharp run-up in the previous couple of trading sessions.

The hourly momentum indicator has a negative crossover which is a sell signal and also suggests that there could be some more consolidation before the uptrend resumes. Overall, this dip should be used a buying opportunity. Bank Nifty is also consolidating after breaking out of the range on the upside. It is likely to resume its up-move towards 47850 – 48000 from a short-term perspective. So the minor degree pullbacks should be used as a buying opportunity.

"On April 2, HDFC Asset Management Company,announced that it would be discontinuing fresh subscriptions and capped systematic investment plan (SIP) flows into its realty index fund. The HDFC Nifty Realty Index Fund, which opened its new fund offering or NFO on March 7 and closed on March 21, is the first ever mutual fund scheme to focus on the realty sector.  While the company has not stated a reason for this, Moneycontrol had reported that, according to market experts, the high valuations and rally in real estate stocks could be the underlying cause.Moneycontrol has reached out to HDFC AMCto get their perspective and will update the copy once they respond. Also read:HDFC Nifty Realty Index Fund stops lumpsum investments, restricts SIPs days after launch Will overvaluation dampen enthusiasm for the sector? Over the last couple of quarters, realty stocks and the seen smart growth. The Nifty Realty Index touched 959.10  points on April 2, led by a bullish outlook for the segment. The last time the index neared this level was in May 2008. Individual stocks have also seen rapid gains on the back of fresh buying of land parcels and new joint ventures being formed. The sector also got a boost when it was the Reserve Bank of India at its recent monetary policy committee meeting decided to keep interest rates unchanged. All this has translated into a good run for realty stocks. Godrej Properties has gained over 116.8 percent (price/earnings multiple of 111.79) over the last one year; while Brigade Enterprises has gained around 96 percent (PE of 70.62). But this in turn has raised questions about valuation, with the PE expanding rapidly over the last one year. Currently, the Nifty Realty PE ratio is around 62.3 times against 38.2 times in April 2023. Returns over the last one year have been around 125 percent. In a January 20 report, CLSA analysts had expressed concerns that a lot of the growth potential had already been factored into valuations. While they were positive that the segment would see growth, the report added that property stocks had gone up sharply over the past three months, and as per their reverse DCF or discounted cash flow valuation, very high growth was already built into current prices, which they believe will be difficult to achieve considering the cyclicality of the sector.  However, not all see this as a problem. According to Karan Khanna, lead analyst, small- and mid-caps, hotels and property, Ambit Capital, only a handful of sectors, including real estate, will experience significant growth of 15-20 percent over the next few years. ""Unlike past cycles, where developers primarily used their operating cash flows for land acquisition and project funding, the current cycle shows developers maintaining control over leverage and adjusting pricing according to demand trends. This suggests that future earnings potential for real estate developers looks promising and robust, which is likely to be reflected in their valuations,” he said. A similar view was expressed by analysts at Nuvama in their March 2024 report. According to the brokerage, even as many real estate stocks are now trading at a premium to their net asset value, valuations are in line with the previous upcycle. ""We argue that value exists on a relative basis given the strong cash flows, all-time low leverage, industry consolidation, and market share gains, and expect buoyancy in housing sales to sustain and stay positive on property stocks from a medium-term perspective,"" the report said. ""Additionally, a potential interest rate cut in CY24E can be a stock catalyst, in our view,"" it added. Also read:Boom in luxury keeps real estate stocks on top. Can the rally sustain? Rupesh Sankhe, senior analyst, utilities, renewables, capital goods and real estate at Elara Capital, said that while commercial real estate may be softer, the residential segment is flourishing, so investors shouldn't worry about high valuations. ""Given the stronger balance sheets and the fact that we're only in the third year of a real estate cycle that typically spans 6–10 years, current valuations appear justified. Furthermore, indicators show that the market is swiftly absorbing new launches, adding to our confidence in its resilience,"" he said. From recovery to outperformance The sector, experts say, had not been doing well for over a decade before showing signs of recovery in 2020, owing to the cyclical nature of the sector. Saurabh Rathi, managing director and co-head, Motilal Oswal Real Estate, said that recent trends show high demand and limited supply, leading to the lowest inventory overhang in years. In CY23., sales were about 5.3 lakh units, the highest in the last 10–12 years. Supply for the same period was only 4.5 lakh units. ""If you would look at data across 2012 to 2021, generally, the supply would have outstripped demand by a significant margin. But because for the last two and a half years demand has been beating supply, today we are standing at an inventory overhang of about 11 months only,"" he explained. "" In my 16–18 year career in real estate, this is the lowest that I've ever seen at a country level. At times, some cities have done well, and they have had a lower inventory overhang. But at an India-level or country-level, 11 months is unheard of. So this is very positive."" For the first time, he added, demand and supply are also backed by a steady increase in price. ""Historically, if you look back at 2012, which was probably a very overheated environment, prices weren't stable. This time around, over the last two years, on average over two years, we have seen a price rise of 15 percent (about 7-8 percent annualised)., which is very, very balanced when such kind of demand comes in. That's a very reasonable price increase,"" he said. This demand is expected to hold for quite some time because while cities like Mumbai and Pune have already seen peak demand and absorption, other markets like Bengaluru, Chennai and the Delhi-NCR area are yet to go back to their peak cycles, providing more scope for growth. Opportunities Most analysts are placing their bets on large real estate developers. Sankhe is positive because these developers are well-prepared with strong projects and solid balance sheets, boasting an equity ratio of just 0.3 times. This, he said, leaves them plenty of room to expand, and they are doing so by actively signing memoranda of understanding, acquiring land and partnering with smaller developers. ""Despite recent stock price increases, today's valuations are underpinned by stronger fundamentals compared to previous real estate booms. Additionally, pent-up demand from the 2014-2020 slowdown is driving growth in the residential sector,"" Sankhe pointed out. Among the large developers on analysts' lists areDLF, Sobha,Lodha, Brigade,Phoenix Millsand Sunteck. While brokerages like Nuvama have a buy call on Godrej Properties, analysts at Ambit have a sell call on the stock due to its ""unfavourable"" valuations. Risks For most analysts tracking the sector, the challenges are currently minimal. While there may be some slowdown in buying and construction during the upcoming election season, demand could pick up as soon as customers have clarity on the results, job creation and earning capacity. According to Khanna, in the long run, execution could be the sole stumbling block. ""The only challenge is continuing with the execution track record over the next two or three years because skilled labor availability will be a challenge, that's one. Second, there could be a slowdown during the election period,"" he added.
","The HDFC Nifty Realty Index Fund has launched its first mutual fund scheme, focusing on the realty sector. The index touched 959.10 points on April 2, led by a bullish outlook for the segment. However, the PE ratio is currently around 62.3 times against 38.2 times in April 2023. Analysts are concerned about valuation, with the PE expanding rapidly over the last one year. Despite this, there are positive factors supporting the sector, such as strong demand and low leverage. However, the sector could face challenges such as execution track record and election season slowdown."

"Shares of Eicher Motors Limited jumped over percent 4 percent in the morning trade on March 20 after global brokerage UBS upgraded its rating to 'buy' with as much as 35 percent upside, citing the company's new launches, and lacklustre performance from peers. At 9.50 am,Eicher Motorsstock was at Rs 3,863, up 4 percent from the previous close. UBS analysts have raised their price target on Eicher Motors stock to Rs 5,000, implying an upside of 34.5 percent from the last close. Despite being aggressively priced, the launches by Harley Davidson and Bajaj Auto's triumph failed to increase volume significantly. As of February 2024, Harley and Triumph's cumulative volume of the models launched stood at around 4,000 units, well below the expected guidance. Follow our live blog for all the market action UBS believes that even as competitors have entered the market aiming to challenge Eichers' dominance, none of them have been able to make a significant impact on customers. Rivals have also attempted to outdo Royal Enfield with better specifications and aggressive pricing but haven't been able to match Royal Enfield's qualitative and emotive edge. ""These aspects are challenging for competitors to replicate."" As per SIAM data, the company's market share in the premium motorcycle segment has risen despite competition. Figures show that its market share in Q2FY23 stood at 42 percent and increased to 45 percent in Q3FY24. Not just that, the company is also planning to launch a new bike -- Roadster. Analysts believe that the launch will bridge the performance gap previously seen when compared to the likes of Harley Davidson and Triumph. This new model offers industry-leading performance, especially featuring Royal Enfield's first liquid-cooled engine, anticipated to address concerns regarding engine heating in hot conditions and heavy traffic. ""We believe the upcoming 450cc roadster, potentially followed by additional body forms, will stimulate replacement demand among Royal Enfield's 350cc customers."", UBS said in a note. On exports, the brokerage anticipates a strong rebound in exports for FY25-FY26, led by the ramp-up of the Himalayan 450, the introduction of additional 650cc models, and a recovery in demand across specific end-markets. UBS projections indicate a 25 percent growth in export demand during FY25-26, contrasting with the 23 percent decline observed in FY24. ""We expect Eicher Motors to outperform the industry on volume growth over the medium term. It continues to have a strong launch pipeline, while most key competitors have already launched products,"" UBS said. It is also expected that Eichers' average selling price will outpace the industry when considering the launch of its new 450cc platform (which could be at a 20-30 percent premium to 350cc series motorcycles) and multiple 650cc launches.

"The recent market correction has taken a toll on energy and power utility stocks as well but there is no cause for alarm yet, say people who track the sector. In a recent report, analysts at Jefferies said opportunities for the power segment could come in through increased capex and higher merchant prices for power following the onset of summer. Over the last three months, the BSE utilities index has gained around 8 percent. Also read:Is this the right time to invest in green hydrogen stocks? Most energy and power utility stocks have been on a tear through 2023, earning them an additional moniker of ""momentum stocks"". The pace of gains moderated towards the end of the year, leading a section of the market to think that valuations may have peaked for the time. Do fund managers overseeing dedicated power sector funds continue to have faith in the growing opportunity within the space and see investment potential? Paras Matalia, Fund Manager, SAMCO Active Momentum Fund, says his fund has reduced exposure to stocks across the sectors as they have been struggling since January this year. “If at all the markets go up again from here, then eventually our equity exposure will also go up based on the momentum,” he says. The fund has power and energy stocks such as PFC, REC, Inox Wind, Adani Power, ONGC, and Power Grid. Launched in July 2023, it has gained around 23 percent to date. Here is what other thematic fund managers have to say: Vikas Gupta,  smallcase manager and CEO, Omniscience Capital Investment Case:Gupta says he was one of the early players in the power space, adding the stock to his portfolios during 2018–2020. The sector has been negative for the last 10 years because there was oversupply and less demand, among other reasons, he says. As many projects could not be completed, it also resulted in a lot of NPAs for power finance companies; hence, people lost interest in the segment. The bet for Gupta has played out well. “We waited patiently for over 1–1.5 years before the value-unlocking began in 2022-2024. Some stocks are rerating four or five times. But even despite that they are valued at 7x or 8x PE, making valuations reasonable,” Gupta says. While selecting stocks, they make conclusions without looking at price action. “I need more value than the price. For example, I need a Rs 100 value, and I need a Rs 50 price. That's the only reason we look at the price. I don't care whether it's going up or down. as long as it is significantly below the intrinsic value,” he says. Gupta continues to see opportunities for growth across all aspects of traditional power — from power finance to transmission and distribution. Many power companies, from NTPC to SJVN and NLC, are doing huge capex. “Most of these companies are getting plans commissioned in the next two years, which will nearly double their revenues in the near future,"" he says but cautions that often ROE in the space may look low because a lot of work that is happening is reported in the capital as work in progress. “But actually, if it's work in progress, I should remove that and adjust to what the return on operating equity is, and that will be quite good, and the same thing will be replicated when these new projects come,” he adds. While most fund managers are excited about the renewable space, there is some scepticism about its valuation. Stocks within the segment are currently priced in the growth opportunity and are often overvalued due to the market buzz about the area, Gupta says. Instead, they prefer to look at traditional players likeNTPCorNHPC, which also have a renewable component, he says. Like Gupta, most fund managersMoneycontrolspoke to said they are open to investing in the space as and when the valuation is right and “the market presents the right opportunity.”. Also read:Abakkus takes a bite of LT Foods. What is the investment case? Power and energy presence in funds Power is a part of many of their diversified small-case portfolios as well as their omni power portfolio, which, according to their websites, has been growing at a 3-year CAGR of 51.73 percent since its launch in 2021. Barring renewables, which are slightly overvalued, Gupta he is bullish across all power stocks — from NTPC to NLC and REC. Rohit Singhania, Co-head - Equity, DSP Mutual Fund Investment case Singhania says that as a house, they have been positive on the power segment due to the strong demand growth in the segment over the last three years. As India moves towards its goal of becoming a manufacturing hub, apart from a demand for labour and land reforms, there will also be a demand for 24x7 power. “If you look at power costs during peak hours, they go up almost twice. This shows the pressure on demand. That means you need more power plants. Till two years ago, the belief was that there was a need for more renewables. But now that everyone has understood, even Europe is talking about thermal power plants and gas-based power plants. So, the entire value chain of people who are setting up, the companies who are going to fund them, are going to benefit from it,” he says. But the key, is the price at which you are getting those businesses. “The scope of activity is quite a lot. You will have that continuing for the next three to four years, if not more, and most of the companies in the value chain are already more or less pricing in most of the growth, barring a few. So that's the worry: You like the business, you like the opportunity, but you're paying everything for the business today itself,” he says. At DSP, they just own very few names where they are comfortable with the business outlook and also with the price. “For me, as a fund manager, it has to be a combination of both — as an investor if you're investing just in the power sector and saying I want to put money in, you have to take a slightly longer call, maybe three or four years because you're not going to get that front-end return,” he says. Power and energy presence in funds DSP’s TIGER. Fund has stocks like NTPC and NHPC, while the New Energy Fund is focused more on the oil and gas parts of the energy supply chain. Over the last five years, the TIGER fund has given 175.6 percent returns and around 55.7 percent in returns over one year. The New Energy Fund has given returns of 145 percent and 41.3 percent for the same periods. In terms of energy stocks, it has oil and gas stocks like Gail, Petronet and Oil India. Sanjay Doshi, Fund Manager -Equity Investments, Nippon Mutual Fund Doshi manages Nippon’s Power and Infrastructure Fund. Investment case:Current valuations are reasonable even for larger companies, he says. “We have to look at it from the capabilities of these companies to make the most of it and how they are moving in it. In that sense, none of these companies have moved above their peak valuations in the last cycle. So given that you have a more regulated structure on returns, which is likely to stay for another five years at least because that's what the new norms have already been out in the public domain, so in that sense, you can definitely trade at 1.8 to 2.5 times your books and all, and then if you add the kicker of renewables and all, the valuations are not expensive, and some of them can definitely see very steady growth and therefore more comfort in valuation over a longer period of time,” Doshi says. Over the past year, the fund has given returns of 31 percent and over 5 percent over 132 percent. Doshi says that they definitely see good growth opportunities and a large capex coming into the power space in the next five to seven years due to power demand. If India has to grow at 7-8 percent plus GDP, then it will definitely require at least 1.2 times the growth in power itself. “Structurally, I think very clearly, we need to have a better mix of renewables within the overall power mix, which today is less than 35 percent, and that needs to go up beyond 50 percent,"" he says. India also needs to ensure we have enough power and energy security; hence, in the near term, we will see higher demand for coal-based power,"" he says. Power and energy presence in funds While the fund is mostly infrastructure-focused, around 18 percent of its allocation is to the power segment through stocks like NTPC,Power Grid,Tata Power, andCESC. Over the past year, the fund has given returns of 70.34 percent and around 204.6 percent over the last five years.

"On April 9, the Nifty settled at 22,642.75, marking a 0.10 percent downturn. The index has rallied nearly 4.5 percent from its previous swing low of 21,710 made on March 20. The volatility index, considered the fear gauge of the market, plunged to its lowest level of 11.36, providing comfort to bulls. A buy-on-dips strategy could be adopted if the Nifty holds above the 22,450 level. However, if the index slips below these levels the bullish momentum could fade out and potentially lead towards the levels around 22,200.

"The Japanese yen hit a 34-year low recently after the Bank of Japan moved to end negative interest rates. Usually, rate hikes strengthen the currency as higher interest rates draw investors putting money in debt. However, in the case of the yen, the message from the central bank officials has been more dovish. The market has taken this as a signal that monetary policy will continue to be accommodative, and this is weighing on the yen. ""The statement suggested that this is not the start of an aggressive rate hiking cycle, even though wage inflation is set to pick up strongly,” said Kunal Sodhani, Shinhan Bank. Also read:Yen on intervention watch; Asia shares subdued “Investors have been selling the yen for the dollar because the interest rate difference is wide; BoJ is following an ultraloose monetary policy and the US Fed, a tight (monetary) policy,” he said. This is the third time in two years that the Yen has fallen as low as 152 to the dollar. On the previous two occasions, there was a strong and sustained reversal. So the market is expecting some intervention by the BoJ around these levels, Sodhani said, adding ""As per charts, USD-JPY is open to 154.00 levels, while a close below 149.20 can bring the pair back into a consolidation phase"". Auto-ancillary companies supplying components to Japanese automakers and Indian banks with yen exposure could benefit from exchange rate gains resulting from a weaker Yen. Additionally, Indian businesses reliant on importing goods and services from Japan might find relief as a softer yen could lower their import costs. This favourable condition could extend across various sectors, including electronics, machinery, automotive, chemicals, and FMCG, Aamir Makda, Commodity & Currency Analyst, Choice Broking told Moneycontrol. Also read:Yen hits 34-year low ahead of key US inflation test The weakening of the Yen, especially to a 34-year low, can have significant impacts on various sectors in India, particularly the automotive industry, according to CA Krishnan R, Director & CEO of Unimoni Financial Services. 90 ""Many Indian companies are collaborating with Japanese companies for technology exchange and components. A weaker yen will make Japanese products relatively cheaper in international markets, and this will be beneficial for the Indian automotive industry, especially Maruti Suzuki,"" he said. Maruti Suzukigave 3.6 percent of the net total income as royalty to its parent entity Suzuki Motor Corporation (Japan) in FY21. Additionally, the value of imports in yen also accounts for 7-8 percent of the company's annual income. Following the slump in yen, Maruti Suzuki shares rose 3 percent on March 27 to hit a fresh record high of Rs 12,722 on NSE. Lumax IndustriesandJTEKT Indiaare poised for favourable outcomes. Lumax Industries' collaboration with Japan-based Stanley Electric Company entails royalty payments in yen, while JTEKT India's transactions with its Japanese parent JTEKT Corporation are denominated in yen. This reduction in costs enhances operational efficiency and also augments financial performance, thereby positively influencing stock values in the automobile and related sectors. Therefore, the yen depreciation directly translates into improved prospects for these stocks affiliating with Japan.
","The Japanese Yen has hit a 34-year low due to the Bank of Japan's dovish message regarding interest rate hikes. The market expects intervention from the BoJ around these levels, which could benefit sectors that rely heavily on exports or imports in Yen. Additionally, the Yen's weakness could impact Indian companies engaged in technology exchanges and component procurement from Japan."
"Motilal Oswal's research report onAU Small Finance Bank We attended AUBANK’s analyst meet, wherein the management provided the outlook of the merged entity as the bank aspires to increase the size of its balance sheet to ~INR2t over the next three years. The merger with Fincare SFB will enable AUBANK to achieve sustainable growth, while stronger return ratios for Fincare will boost profitability, particularly as operating leverage improves. After the merger, the bank is expected to expand into new geographical areas and product segments, with robust growth in high-yielding Wheels, MFI, Gold and SBL segments. Moreover, since Fincare is a rural-focused SFB with 85% of its advances qualifying under the priority sector, the merger will enable AUBANK to not only meet its PSL target but also generate PSLC income in the long run.

"Shares of PNB Housing Finance zoomed over 8 percent on April 1 after Morgan Stanley put an 'overweight' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 970 per share. The international brokerage's call comes after CARE Ratings and ICRA upgraded the company's long-term rating to 'AA+' citing improvements in the company's asset quality. The upgrade is also supported by the housing finance company's strengthened capital position and diversified resource profile. The fourth quarter typically sees strong performance for housing finance companies due to loan growth and improved asset quality, noted Morgan Stanley. With valuation standing at 1x FY25 P/B and 9x P/E, PNB Housing appears attractive to investors, the brokerage said. CARE Ratings upgradedPNB Housingto 'AA+' from 'AA' with a ‘stable’ outlook from ‘positive’ due to its improving asset quality and strong market position. The ratings upgrade is applicable to a range of facilities and debt instruments, including its long-term and short-term bank facilities, bonds, non-convertible bonds, tier-2 bonds, and fixed deposits. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action The ratings agency said the upgrade reflected the improved asset quality of the housing finance company, with its gross NPA ratio at 1.73 percent at the end of December 2023, compared to 8 percent in March last year. The stable outlook was on the expectation that the housing financier would show profitable business growth along with healthy resource-raising ability and strong internal accruals. ICRA has upgraded the company's debt instrument rating to 'ICRA AA+ (Stable)' from 'ICRA AA (Positive)'. The rating upgrade factors in the sustained improvement in PNB Housing Finance's credit profile, driven by the improved asset quality metrics and the strengthened capitalisation profile. Given the intense competition in the mortgage finance business, the company's ability to maintain its net interest margin while improving its operating efficiency and controlling the credit costs will be important from a credit perspective, it said.

The momentum setup on the hourly time frame suggests exhaustion of selling pressure as there are signs of a positive divergence. It currently has a positive crossover. In terms of price pattern, the daily candle has taken the form of a Doji pattern, which suggests indecision among market participants regarding the direction as both bulls and bears are trying hard to defend their boundaries.
