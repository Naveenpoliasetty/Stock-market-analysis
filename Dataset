however, towards the end of the day, the index came off from highs and finally settled at 22,434.65 with a loss of 18.65 points. among the sectors, psu banking was the top performer followed by it and media while profit booking pressure was observed in the realty stocks. buying traction remained in the broader markets as mid and smallcaps gained further by 0.52% & 1.16% respectively. the index is oscillating in the range of 22,350-22,500, breakout on either side will provide proper direction. indian rupee ended marginally lower at 83.43 per dollar versus tuesday's close of 83.38. in the highly volatile session, the indian equity indices ended on a flat note on april 3. at close, the sensex was down 27.09 points or 0.04 percent at 73,876.82, and the nifty was down 18.60 points or 0.08 percent at 22,434.70. about 2623 shares advanced, 914 shares declined, and 82 shares unchanged. shriram finance, ntpc, tcs, axis bank and tech mahindra were among major gainers on the nifty, while losers were nestle india, bajaj auto, kotak mahindra bank, britannia industries and dr reddy's laboratories. on the sectoral front, the realty index was down 2.5 percent and the auto index slipped 0.4 percent. on the other hand, power, psu bank indices up 1 percent each, and information technology, media index up 0.5 percent each.","nifty: closed at 22,434.65 points, down 18.65 points or 0.08%. traded in a narrow range with a negative bias. sector-wise, it and financial services edged higher, while realty and fmcg closed in the red.sensex: closed at 73,876.82 points, down 27.09 points or 0.04%. traded in a narrow range with a negative bias. sector-wise, psu bank index up 1 percent, and the it index gained 0.5%.overall: the indian equity indices ended on a flat note on april 3, tracking mixed cues. there was weakness in global markets, triggered by a gap-down start, but buying pressure in select heavyweights pared losses promptly. the nifty remained volatile throughout the day but managed to hold above key moving averages.","**Negative sentiment**

"india's benchmark sensex and nifty faced their first weekly decline after four weeks of gains and posted around two percent loss during the week, the steepest weekly decline in 20 weeks. broad-based selling and a meltdown in mid and smallcap stocks continued, alarming investors amidst regulatory warnings. the benchmark sensex lost 2.2 percent during the week while nifty fell 2.1 percent. this was the steepest weekly fall since october 2023. bse midcap and smallcap lost around 4 percent and 6 percent, respectively. weakness in global equities, driven by discouraging us data, reduced expectations of a federal reserve interest rate cut, further dampening sentiments. separate reports on thursday revealed that us producer prices exceeded forecasts in february, while fewer individuals applied for and received jobless benefits than anticipated, weakening the case for a rate cut by the fed. bse midcap and smallcap stocks have faced heavy selling since mid-february, following sebi's directive to mutual funds to safeguard investors amidst concerns of overheating. analysts anticipated the decline due to inflated valuations post-2023 bull run, with bse smallcap up 74 percent and midcap index over 60 percent in the past year, raising caution. the ongoing market correction is seen as healthy, aiming to balance overbought zones, analysts said. the sebi chairperson recently announced mandatory disclosure for mutual funds focusing on stress testing by march 15. this aims to gauge how quickly funds can exit portfolios during stress. it addresses challenges faced during redemptions in illiquid markets. the disclosure informs investors about potential outcomes in small-cap and mid-cap funds during stress. amfi also outlined stress test guidelines for small-cap and midcap schemes, directing fund houses to submit results every 15 days, with the first report due by march 15. these tests reveal portfolio liquidity, crucial for swift investor withdrawals during market collapses and increased redemptions. outlook for march 18 prashanth tapse, senior vp (research), mehta equities: domestic equities followed global cues as weak us and asian markets fuelled extended profit-taking with investors selling auto, oil & gas, banking and power stocks. the recent subdued economic readings related to inflation and iip numbers too didn't help either, which further aggravated the bearish mood during the week. with uncertainty around, local investors will closely follow global markets to decide on their exposure to equities. ajit mishra, svp - technical research, religare broking: markets traded lackluster amid mixed cues and lost over half a percent. after the initial downtick, the nifty inched gradually lower and almost reached closer to thursday's low. though it tried to recoup losses in the latter half, pressure on select heavyweights capped the recovery. eventually, it settled at 22,024 level; down by 0.53 percent. most sectors traded in line with the move and settled in the red wherein auto, energy and pharma were among the top losers. meanwhile, the broader indices traded mixed and that resulted in neutral market breadth. indications are in favor of consolidation with negative bias until the nifty decisively reclaims 22,250 levels. however, the pace of decline would remain gradual citing the resilience of select heavyweights across sectors. traders should continue with a stock-specific approach and maintain positions on both sides. shrikant chouhan, head equity research, kotak securities: in the last week, the benchmark indices witnessed profit booking at higher levels, after a sharp decline the nifty ended 2.20 percent lower while the sensex shed over 1600 points. among sectors, the majority of sectoral indices witnessed profit booking at higher levels reality and media indices lost the most, shed nearly 9 percent. technically, on weekly charts the index has formed a long bearish candle and it is also trading below the 20 day sma (simple moving average) which is largely negative. we are of the view that, as long as the index is trading below 20 day sma or 22200/73200 the weak formation is likely to continue. below the same, the market could slip till 21800-21700/72000-71700. on the flip side, for the bulls 22150/73000 and 22200/73200- or 20-day sma would be the key resistance areas. fresh uptrend rally possible only after dismissal of 20 day sma or 73200. above the same, it could retest the level of 22300-22350/73500-73700 for bank nifty, 50 day sma or 46500 would act as a sacrosanct zone, above the same, it could move up till 47200-47500. on the other side, below 50 day sma uptrend would be vulnerable. rupak de, senior technical analyst, lkp securities: the nifty has once again closed below the rising trendline, bringing market sentiment back into a state of weakness. the momentum indicator suggests bearish momentum in the near term. immediate support is situated at the 50dma, currently at 21,900, which is expected to provide support for the nifty. a decisive drop below 21,900 could lead to a sharp decline in the index. on the upside, resistance is observed in the range of 22,200-22,250.","sensex and nifty weekly performance: sensex lost 2.2% during the week, while nifty fell 2.1%. this was the steepest weekly decline since october 2023. broad-based selling and a meltdown in mid and smallcap stocks continued.global market context: us producer prices exceeded forecasts in february, which reduced expectations of a federal reserve interest rate cut. weaknesses in global equities, driven by discouraging us data, further dampened sentiments.market analysis: the ongoing market correction is seen as healthy, aiming to balance overbought zones. analysts anticipate the decline due to inflated valuations post-2023 bull run. the recent subdued economic readings related to inflation and iip numbers further aggravated the bearish mood during the week.outlook for march 18: the nifty is expected to close below the 22,250 levels, with a potential for further decline if the momentum indicator suggests bearish momentum. the sensex could retest the level of 22300-22350 if the 20-day sma holds above the resistance zone.additional points: separate reports on thursday revealed that us producer prices exceeded forecasts in february, which reduced expectations of a federal reserve interest rate cut. the ongoing market correction is seen as healthy, aiming to balance overbought zones, analysts said. traders should continue with a stock-specific approach and maintain positions on both sides.","**Negative sentiment**

"nifty it will put up a strong show in the short term as it has rebounded from the crucial support zone of 36,600, which is 23.6 percent fibonacci retracement level for the recent swing from 30,054 to 38,559, anticipates sudeep shah of sbi securities. the deputy vice-president and head of the technical and derivative research desk at sbi securities believes that the nifty it index will test the 38,500 level in the short term. seasoned for more than 15 years in technical and derivatives research, shah estimates that the 21,900 - 21,850 zone will be crucial support for the nifty 50. sustaining below 21,850 will lead to an extension of the correction up to 21,500 in the short term, he said. here's the excerpts from an interaction on the market withmoneycontrol: do you think the nifty has entered the consolidation mode with support at 21,860 or there is a possibility of another round of correction up to 21,500 in the coming sessions? last week, ended march 15, after a rising channel breakdown in the nifty on the daily scale, the index has taken support around 21,900-21,930 zone as it is the confluence of 50-day ema (exponential moving average) and the prior swing low. apart from nifty index trading below its 20-day ema level, the 20-day ema has started edging lower. the charts of large-cap stocks display a mixed picture in addition to some weakness being observed in the momentum indicators and oscillators for the nifty. hence, we feel that these factors are hinting at a possible consolidation for the nifty in the near term. the 21,900 - 21,850 zone will be a crucial support for the index. sustaining below 21,850 will lead to an extension of the correction up to 21,500 levels in the short term. on the upside, the zone of 22,200-22,250 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index. sustaining above the 22,250 level, the index would resume its journey up to 22,530-22,700. stocks that look structurally strong, especially after the recent steep fall... based on relative strength charts, large-caps such as ambuja cements, bharti airtel, cipla, colpal, hdfc amc, nestle india and tcs look structurally strong with promising signs of outperformance, while persistent systems, dixon technologies and l&t technology services look strong from the mid-cap space. also read:what should you do with your mid and small-cap holdings amid heightened volatility? experts weigh in do you think the worst is over for midcap and smallcap indices? after the fierce sell-off in the first half of the week ended march 15, the nifty midcap and smallcap indices have seen minor pullback in the last two trading sessions. but the worst is not over. we feel underperformance in these indices when compared to nifty would continue. one needs to be extremely stock-specific and choose the stocks wisely, which are structurally strong on charts backed by strong fundaments. for the midcap index, we feel that the 100-day ema zone of 45,300-45,500 could act as an important support, while 47,400-47,500 zone would act as a potential resistance on the upside. the nifty smallcap index is relatively weaker than midcap index. while the midcap index is 6 percent down from its all-time high, the smallcap barometer has corrected over 12 percent from its highs. we expect the index to consolidate negatively between 20 dema zone of 15,300 on the upside and 13,900 on the downside. also read:keep your portfolio in green even when market turns red: here's a blueprint from experts does the private bank index look better than the psu bank index? looking at the ratio chart of nifty private bank index to nifty psu bank index, clear signs of outperformance by private banks are visible since past few trading sessions. tracking the levels, the nifty private bank index has key supports placed at 22,800-23,000 zone, which is the 200-day ema level as well as the upward sloping trendline zone. the charts of heavyweight stocks such as hdfc bank and icici bank in the nifty private banks index show promising signs. psu bank index, which has breached its recent swing low, needs to cross and sustain above its 10-20 ema zone of 6,950-7,000 zone for it to witness a resurgence in momentum on the upside. which sector is entering in decisive breakout?

"reliance industries shares jumped over 3 percent on march 27 after goldman sachs reiterated a 'buy' rating on reliance industries ltd, with as much as a 54 percent upside by fy26 in its bull case, citing favourable risk-reward dynamics, value unlocking from its disney joint venture, and enhanced return on capital investments. with the capex cycle in two capital-intensive businesses, retail and jio telecom, reaching its peak, ril will now start seeing improvements in its overall performance, said goldman sachs analysts. the brokerage raised the target price on therilstock to rs 4,495 in the bull case and rs 3,400 in the base case, implying a 17 percent return from the previous closing price. reliance industries shares tend to outperform the indian market under two conditions: expanding returns and valuation discovery through stake sales in newer businesses, the brokerage said.

"according to raghvendra nath, the md of ladderup wealth management, psu stocks have reached the overvalued territory, and it's only a matter of time before the bubble bursts. in an interview with moneycontrol, he suggested exiting the segment due to the high allocation towards the pse sector. considering the high allocation towards pse sector, he believes exiting the segment would make sense. due to the rally in the recent past one year, ""we may experience market consolidation or sideways movement in the near term. but the fundamentally strong companies will bounce back from the corrections relatively unscathed,"" says raghvendra nath, who has more than 29 years of corporate experience. do you think investors should book profits in psu space after recent run up? the psu stocks have seen an impeccable rally in the past 1 year with the pse index (public sector enterprise) rising over 100 percent in the same period. this rally was fuelled by the increasing order book in sectors such as railways and energy while the surge in psu banks was seen due to an improvement in the balance sheet and healthy loan growth. these improvements in the pse sector coupled with the low float of these companies has caused a euphoria making the stocks runway ahead from their fundamentals. however, continuing the same growth momentum would be a hurdle for these stocks as they have a knack for slow execution and poor governance. historically, post elections we have also seen a slowdown in the order book which would cause more problems for the pse segment. coming onto the valuation point of view, the historical pe ratios of railway stocks has been in the range of 10-15 times while currently they are trading at a pe of 30-40 times, psu banks which used to trade around a p/b ratio of 1 to 1.5 times have almost doubled to trade at a p/b ratio of 2-3 times. energy & railway stocks have also seen their pe ratios increase by 20 percent-30 percent from their historical levels. clearly these stocks have entered into the overvalued territory and it's just a matter of time before the bubble would burst. also read:small, midcaps to outperform largecaps this year as economy pivots to manufacturing: emkay the recent plummet in the markets saw the pse index fall 10 percent in 5 days, showing signs of concerns in this segment. considering the high allocation towards this sector, we believe exiting the segment would make sense as they have clearly forayed into a territory of extreme overvaluation. is it the good time to bottom fish in the midcap it space and stay with the same segment instead of largecap it space? on macro level, largecaps are trading at relatively attractive valuation as compared to midcap it space. but the it companies in general have shown good returns in past 6 months. there are some opportunities in the space, but selective stock-picking will be preferred over betting on the sector. do you surprise if the market sees sharp correction in coming weeks despite more tailwinds than less headwinds? we have seen some correction in past weeks in small and mid-cap index, and the space is likely to experience headwinds in coming days. this is again due to the caution from sebi, and froth building up in the market. due to the rally in the recent past one year, we may experience market consolidation or sideways movement in the near term. but the fundamentally strong companies will bounce back from the corrections relatively unscathed. do you think the stress tests in amc is one of key reasons for nervousness in the equity markets?

of nearly 2 percent over the week, the nifty smallcap 250 index faced a substantial correction of 6 percent, and the nifty midcap 150 index declined by over 4 percent. despite this market turmoil,

"chemical companies in india are clearly looking at the bigger picture. even as they face a continued global demand slowdown, they are not holding back on capital expenditure to enhance capacity, despite this adding to stress on their balance sheets. however, the near-term pain could mean long-term gain given that the outlook for the country's chemicals sector is robust, especially helped by the capacities coming onstream now. the impact of destocking in europe and the us has significantly dented global demand, while a decline in chinese demand has prompted companies there to offload inventories in other regions. this has collectively resulted in a downward pressure on prices. ""in several of the segments, despite a poor global demand, china appears to have been raising its production in 2023, putting downward pressure on realisations, especially for domestic players,"" brokerage firm prabhudas lilladher highlighted. the weak demand environment also coincided with a time when domestic chemical players were going big on capacity expansion to reap the benefits of the growing china+1 sentiment. but in the face of the demand slowdown, chemical players are now feeling the heat of the ongoing capital expenditure, which is weighing on their margins. slow demand, margin pressure drive bearish ratings on chemical stocks anticipating prolonged pressure on demand and margins for the chemicals sector, prabhudas lilladher, like many other brokerages, opted for a cautious view. the firm has a 'hold' rating on gujarat fluorochemicals, jubilant ingrevia, clean science technology and fine organic industries. it has a 'reduce' call on srf, vinati organics, aarti industries, deepak nitrate and nocil. the brokerage has a 'sell' recommendation on laxmi organic. in contrast, navin fluorine emerged as the only chemical stock garnering an upgrade to 'buy' from the brokerage, largely due to the recent correction in the stock price. the concerns of further pressure on the sector become clearer when one looks at their q3 report card. chemical companies' revenues, margins hit in the fiscal third quarter, 8 out of 22 chemical companies recorded their lowest quarterly sales since the covid-19 outbreak. four companies' sales were close to their lowest quarterly numbers since the pandemic. additionally, 16 of these companies reported a year-on-year decline in revenue. also read |indian chemical players had big hopes riding on china+1, but reality dashes them furthermore, 12 companies witnessed a drop in gross margins compared to the same quarter last year, with 8 of them also reporting a sequential decline. the situation was more challenging concerning ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margins primarily due to the aggressive capex undertaken. eighteen companies reported a year-on-year decline while 11 showed a sequential contraction in ebitda margins. pain to continue for a few more quarters the sector was once among india's brighter prospects due to china+1 and a slump in european specialty chemicals production. however, changing dynamics globally suggest that pain due to muted demand and pricing pressure is likely to persist till at least the first quarter of fy25, meaning there is still a long way for the stock prices of chemical companies to recover from a correction that began last year. ak prabhakar, head of research at idbi capital, said the six-month outlook for the sector is not encouraging for investors. ""one or more quarters of bad results will be possible. people who have long-term views need not worry,"" he said. long-term outlook bright while the near-term pressure is most likely to persist, analysts as well as industry participants are bullish on the sector's long-term growth trajectory, also helped by the capacity expansion under way. maulik patel, chairman and managing director at chemicals company epigral, is already seeing green shoots emerging in the domestic market and anticipates global demand to normalise by the end of the first half of fy25. that is when he expects the increased capacity of the domestic chemical industry to begin yielding results. patel also justifies the capex undertaken by chemical majors even as demand remained muted. he believes the capex will push india up the ladder when competing with china, which is the world's largest producer of chemicals. ""china is strong in the specialty chemical space as it commands a fully vertical integration of production. in that context, indian chemical companies stood at a disadvantage if they did not move towards the path of vertical integration. hence, the recent capex unleashed by the industry will help in presenting itself as an alternate vendor to china when demand revives,"" patel said in an interaction withmoneycontrol. patel is also betting on the domestic demand to aid a recovery in the industry.

"the week ended march 28 proved to be a resounding success for bullish investors in the domestic markets, leading to a highly optimistic closure for the week, month, and the financial year. despite being truncated because of two national holidays, the nifty index consistently traded in the positive territory across sessions. throughout the last week, there were notable attempts by the benchmark to surpass the significant 22,500 mark, indicating a strong bullish sentiment in the market, although it ultimately closed below this threshold. the last week, however, concluded with gains of over a percent, reflecting the positive momentum and sentiment among investors. overall, it was a week marked by optimism and upward momentum, underscoring the resilience and confidence in the domestic markets. last week, our analysis centered around the crucial support of the 50-day exponential moving average (dema) for the nifty index. additionally, we delved into the bullish harmonic shark pattern and the morning star candlestick pattern. the impact of these technical indicators was evidently observed throughout the week, as they contributed to pulling the index back to the significant 22,500 mark. however, a notable occurrence during the final hour of the preceding trading session led to a substantial pullback, driving the index towards the 22,300 mark, prompting a degree of scepticism in our outlook. despite our prior bullish stance, we now anticipate fresh rounds of buying activity only if the index surpasses the 22,500 level or nears the 22,100 levels, owing to the emergence of negative divergence in the relative strength index (rsi) across multiple time frames. this divergence signifies a potential short-term reversal in momentum. for the medium term, we maintain our optimistic outlook, asserting that as long as the support at 21,700 remains intact, the index retains the potential for further upward movement. looking ahead, the short-term support level has been adjusted to 22,000 for the current week starting from april 1, underscoring the dynamic nature of market trends and the importance of vigilant analysis in navigating fluctuations. here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks: orient cement: buy | ltp: rs 196 | stop-loss: rs 179 | target: rs 225 | return: 15 percent following a peak near the rs 293 level, orient cement encountered a notable downturn, marked by a sharp decline of 35 percent in its overall value. despite this downturn, orient cement has shown signs of stabilisation around rs 190 levels for the last week, establishing a sustained support base. it's noteworthy that the level of rs 190 aligns with the fibonacci ratio clustering, as indicated in the chart. moreover, during this period, a 1:1 leg has also formed around this support zone, further reinforcing a bullish sentiment in the stock. an analysis of the daily scale rsi indicator reveals a bullish hidden divergence, suggesting a favourable outlook for orient cement. taking into account these factors along with chart patterns, investors may find it prudent to consider initiating buy positions within the range of rs 190-198, with an upside objective of rs 225. to manage the risks effectively, it's advisable to set a stop-loss order at rs 179 on a daily closing basis, providing protection against potential downside movements. abb india: buy | ltp: rs 6,361 | stop-loss: rs 5,950 | target: rs 7,000 | return: 10 percent in the recent trading session, abb india showed a significant breakout above the r4 camarilla pivot (rs 6,111.4), maintaining its position above this level. additionally, daily stochastics have ventured into the overbought territory, suggesting a bullish momentum anticipated in the upcoming days. the combination of price action persisting above the r4 camarilla pivot and stochastics registering as overbought presents a compelling technical confluence, reinforcing the bullish sentiment surrounding abb india. investors may consider initiating a 'buy' position within the range of rs 6,250-6,400, targeting an upside potential of rs 7,000, while prudently placing a stop-loss near rs 5,950 based on the daily closing prices. hindustan unilever: buy | ltp: rs 2,264 | stop-loss: rs 2,145 | target: rs 2,500 | return: 10 percent since reaching its peak around the rs 2,669 mark on january 1, 2024, hindustan unilever has experienced a notable downturn, witnessing a significant decline of approximately 16 percent. however, in the subsequent six trading sessions, hindustan unilever has displayed resilience, avoiding further declines and instead consolidating within a range spanning from rs 2,230 to rs 2,280. notably, within this price range, a bullish ab=cd pattern has formed on the daily chart of hindustan unilever. this range also corresponds with the 0.50 percent retracement level of a price swing observed between march 2022 and july 2023, as depicted on the chart. additionally, on a daily scale, the rsi has exhibited a complex structure (w shape) along with some regular bull divergence on the 4-hour chart. interestingly, the mentioned range of rs 2,230-2,280 aligns with s5 camarilla pivot (rs 2,243), suggesting a potentially attractive buying opportunity. therefore, it might be prudent to consider buying within the range of rs 2,250-2,280, aiming for an upside target of rs 2,500, while setting a stop-loss near rs 2,145 on a daily closing basis. this comprehensive analysis highlights potential trading opportunities and risk management strategies for traders and investors considering positions in hindustan unilever.","week summary: the nifty index closed with gains of over 1%, marking a positive week for bullish investors. support at 22,500 mark remained intact,

""the capex cycle theme drives several of our top picks (ambuja, axis, jsw energy, l&t, macrotech). other themes to play include government manufacturing push (amber), state-owned enterprise reforms (sbi), penetration stories (max health, zomato), financialisation of savings (axis, sbi) and key consumer / bottom-of-pyramid ideas (bharti, tvs)."" let's take a look the 11 stocks that made it to jefferies list of top picks. amber enterprises:jefferies touted amber enterprises as the key beneficiary of india's manufacturing growth narrative, particularly within the small and midcap space. the company's core competency in acs and diversification into components, supported by the government's production-linked incentive (pli) scheme, is projected to drive a cagr of 36 percent in earnings from 2024 to 2030. ambuja cements:as the second-largest cement producer in india, ambuja cements is expected to achieve strong operational performance compared to its peers. factors contributing to the bullishness include the company's increased capacity, cost cutting and investments in green power, which combined are expected to drive 19 percent ebitda cagr. axis bank:jefferies forecasts an earnings per share (eps) cagr of 18 percent for axis bank from 2024 to 2029. this growth trajectory is attributed to improvements in deposit franchises, ramp-ups in the digital and lending platforms, and the expansion of subsidiaries. the integration of citibank india is also seen as a catalyst for cost and revenue synergies, while initiatives like hyper-personalisation platforms and loans for small and rural enterprises are expected to drive loan growth. jefferies also sees potential for valuation re-rating. follow our live blog for all the market action bharti airtel:jefferies has a favourable opinion on bharti airtel due to its consistent market share gains and improving pricing environment, with room for growth in average revenue per user (arpu). the brokerage expects a 12 percent to 13 percent cagr in india revenue or ebitda from 2024 to 2030, driven by market share expansion and higher arpu. the generation of consistent free cash flow is seen as a factor that could lead to a shift in valuation benchmarks towards free cash flow yields, jefferies believes. jsw energy:jefferies outlines three potential triggers for jsw energy over the next 12-24 months, including increased visibility in renewable energy capacity, commissioning of a 700 mw merchant capacity during peak power demand, and progress on green hydrogen plants and energy storage batteries. the company's execution capabilities and prudent cash flow utilisation are expected to maintain elevated multiples and create shareholder value in the medium term. larsen & toubro:jefferies identifies larsen & toubro (l&t) as a significant beneficiary of india's capital expenditure upswing, projecting a 25 percent eps cagr and an 18-20 percent return on equity (roe). the potential for re-rating is also open given sustained eps growth and shareholder-friendly capital allocation policies. however, risks include management's capital allocation decisions and government spending on infrastructure. macrotech developers:according to jefferies,macrotech developers stands to benefit from the current housing capex cycle and its substantial land bank in mumbai's suburbs. jefferies expects a 15-20 percent medium-term pre-sales cagr driven by land value resets and expansion into new geographies. max healthcare:jefferies sees max healthcare as a potentially lucrative investment with sustained growth momentum in the hospital business. the brokerage expects a 20 percent average ebitda growth rate from 2024-30, driven by new bed additions and efficient operations. however, the brokerage also sees some risks for the healthcare firm which include construction delays and overpriced acquisitions. state bank of india:jefferies has an optimistic view of the state bank of india's (sbi) prospects, citing its strong deposit base, digital offerings, and leadership in lending segments. alongside, the ability to raise capital and potential valuation re-rating are viewed as growth drivers. tvs motor:jefferies expects tvs motor to benefit from the revival in indian two-wheeler demand, narrowing profitability gaps with peers, and strong earnings growth prospects. however, the brokerage stands concerned over the company's investments in overseas entities with unclear strategies. zomato:jefferies considers zomato as a compelling food delivery investment with strong growth potential and profitability. ebitda break-even for blinkit and visible profit pool growth over the next five years are key upside triggers, with capital allocation strategies being a key factor to monitor.","amber enterprises key beneficiary of india's manufacturing growth narrative stable growth through government-linked incentive scheme (pli) diversified portfolio in components and acsambuja

indices to record highs and benefiting stocks. us fed decided to maintain the interest rates aligned with market expectations. the decision was unanimous, reflecting the consensus among participants who see no immediate need for rate hikes. highlights from the us central bank included a dovish outlook for the coming year, with the fed retaining the projected three rate cuts for the year despite a

"india has beaten rest of the asian markets by attracting the highest foreign funds flow in march, defying geopolitical crises and concerns that the higher interest rate regime will continue for some more time. foreign institutional investors (fiis) pumped $3.63 billion into indian equities in their biggest buying binge since december 2023. domestic institutions continued to be net buyers, investing around rs 52,467 crore in the market to hit a four-year high. outside india, south korea, taiwan and indonesia were the investment destinations for fiis, while they chose to pull out money from markets in japan, malaysia, the philippines, thailand, vietnam and sri lanka. south korea received inflows of $2.91 billion, taiwan $1.14 billion and indonesia $585 million. the japanese market recorded the biggest fii outflow of $5.35 billion, followed by thailand and malaysia at $1.13 billion and $514 million. in vietnam, the outflow reached $197 million, and $40 million in the philippines. deepak jasani, head of retail research at hdfc securities, attributed the net fii figures to purchases of stocks through block deals and index rebalancing in march. a steep correction in the market also threw up an opportunity to buy undervalued stocks, including small and mid-caps. for diis, cash reserves helped raise their equity holdings. with march being the year-end month, investors try to book fresh positions and clean up their books. this also fuelled the buying binge, according to him. march witnessed significant block trades, including bat plc selling its stake in itc for rs 17,485 crore, rakesh gangwal divesting in interglobe aviation for over rs 7,800 crore, tata sons selling off around 1 percent stake in tata consultancy services for rs 9,000 crore, and singtel diluting its stake in bharti airtel for rs 5,849 crore. gaurav misra, head - equity at mirae asset investment managers, said domestic institutions have been buyers and fiis sellers in aggregate, except for msci-related rebalancing. domestic mutual funds and possibly aif have been sitting on cash which would have been deployed in stocks where they have bottom-up comfort. this is despite some cohorts of the market being at a premium. so far in march, the benchmark sensex and nifty indices lost 0.1 percent each, while bse midcap and smallcap declined 0.7 percent and 5.53 percent. the correction in the indian markets were triggered by factors such as ed raids on a major market player, sebi warning about market froth, concerns about liquidity stress tests by mutual funds, and fears of rbi intervention against stock market inflows. analysts said that despite the buying binge of the institutional investors, liquidity has dried up after recent actions by the rbi and enforcement agencies, impacting market operators and hnis reliant on leverage. they added that nbfcs were reassessing lending against shares, reducing the overdraft facilities for hnis. this forced liquidation of positions, triggering a cycle of falling prices and panic selling. however, analysts expect mutual fund sip flows are expected to remain stable, and attractive valuations may draw in investors waiting on the sidelines. stocks linked to dubious entities might take longer to recover, while fundamentally sound ones may rebound more swiftly, they added. brokerage nuvama research in its latest report suggests turning bullish after the recent correction in mid and small-cap stocks. they view the current phase as a correction within an ongoing bull market, reaching oversold conditions at key support levels, recommending long positions. the broader market, previously overheated, has undergone a healthy decline, likely marking the end of the correction phase and the resumption of the bull market. large caps have also experienced corrective phases without significant damage to the nifty50. strong global market tailwinds, upcoming earnings seasons, and general elections indicate favorable risk premiums for long positions in the market, it added.","foreign institutional investors: india received the highest foreign funds flow in march, with $3.63 billion pumped in through block deals and index rebalancing. south korea received $2.91 billion, taiwan received $1.14 billion, and indonesia received $585 million. the japanese market experienced the biggest fii outflow of $5.35 billion, followed by thailand and malaysia at $1.13 billion and $514 million.domestic investors: domestic institutions were net buyers, investing around rs 52,467 crore in the market to hit a four-year high. cash reserves helped raise equity holdings for diis.stocks movement: benchmark sensex and nifty indices lost 0.1 percent each, while bse midcap and smallcap declined 0.7 percent and 5.53 percent respectively. the correction in the indian markets was triggered by factors such as ed raids, market froth concerns, and liquidity stress tests.","**Positive sentiment**

"on april 2, hdfc asset management company,announced that it would be discontinuing fresh subscriptions and capped systematic investment plan (sip) flows into its realty index fund. the hdfc nifty realty index fund, which opened its new fund offering or nfo on march 7 and closed on march 21, is the first ever mutual fund scheme to focus on the realty sector. while the company has not stated a reason for this, moneycontrol had reported that, according to market experts, the high valuations and rally in real estate stocks could be the underlying cause.moneycontrol has reached out to hdfc amcto get their perspective and will update the copy once they respond. also read:hdfc nifty realty index fund stops lumpsum investments, restricts sips days after launch will overvaluation dampen enthusiasm for the sector? over the last couple of quarters, realty stocks and the seen smart growth. the nifty realty index touched 959.10 points on april 2, led by a bullish outlook for the segment. the last time the index neared this level was in may 2008. individual stocks have also seen rapid gains on the back of fresh buying of land parcels and new joint ventures being formed. the sector also got a boost when it was the reserve bank of india at its recent monetary policy committee meeting decided to keep interest rates unchanged. all this has translated into a good run for realty stocks. godrej properties has gained over 116.8 percent (price/earnings multiple of 111.79) over the last one year; while brigade enterprises has gained around 96 percent (pe of 70.62). but this in turn has raised questions about valuation, with the pe expanding rapidly over the last one year. currently, the nifty realty pe ratio is around 62.3 times against 38.2 times in april 2023. returns over the last one year have been around 125 percent. in a january 20 report, clsa analysts had expressed concerns that a lot of the growth potential had already been factored into valuations. while they were positive that the segment would see growth, the report added that property stocks had gone up sharply over the past three months, and as per their reverse dcf or discounted cash flow valuation, very high growth was already built into current prices, which they believe will be difficult to achieve considering the cyclicality of the sector. however, not all see this as a problem. according to karan khanna, lead analyst, small- and mid-caps, hotels and property, ambit capital, only a handful of sectors, including real estate, will experience significant growth of 15-20 percent over the next few years. ""unlike past cycles, where developers primarily used their operating cash flows for land acquisition and project funding, the current cycle shows developers maintaining control over leverage and adjusting pricing according to demand trends. this suggests that future earnings potential for real estate developers looks promising and robust, which is likely to be reflected in their valuations,"" he said. a similar view was expressed by analysts at nuvama in their march 2024 report. according to the brokerage, even as many real estate stocks are now trading at a premium to their net asset value, valuations are in line with the previous upcycle. ""we argue that value exists on a relative basis given the strong cash flows, all-time low leverage, industry consolidation, and market share gains, and expect buoyancy in housing sales to sustain and stay positive on property stocks from a medium-term perspective,"" the report said. ""additionally, a potential interest rate cut in cy24e can be a stock catalyst, in our view,"" it added. also read:boom in luxury keeps real estate stocks on top. can the rally sustain? rupesh sankhe, senior analyst, utilities, renewables, capital goods and real estate at elara capital, said that while commercial real estate may be softer, the residential segment is flourishing, so investors shouldn't worry about high valuations. ""given the stronger balance sheets and the fact that we're only in the third year of a real estate cycle that typically spans 6-10 years, current valuations appear justified. furthermore, indicators show that the market is swiftly absorbing new launches, adding to our confidence in its resilience,"" he said. from recovery to outperformance the sector, experts say, had not been doing well for over a decade before showing signs of recovery in 2020, owing to the cyclical nature of the sector. saurabh rathi, managing director and co-head, motilal oswal real estate, said that recent trends show high demand and limited supply, leading to the lowest inventory overhang in years. in cy23., sales were about 5.3 lakh units, the highest in the last 10-12 years. supply for the same period was only 4.5 lakh units. ""if you would look at data across 2012 to 2021, generally, the supply would have outstripped demand by a significant margin. but because for the last two and a half years demand has been beating supply, today we are standing at an inventory overhang of about 11 months only,"" he explained. "" in my 16-18 year career in real estate, this is the lowest that i've ever seen at a country level. at times, some cities have done well, and they have had a lower inventory overhang. but at an india-level or country-level, 11 months is unheard of. so this is very positive."" for the first time, he added, demand and supply are also backed by a steady increase in price. ""historically, if you look back at 2012, which was probably a very overheated environment, prices weren't stable. this time around, over the last two years, on average over two years, we have seen a price rise of 15 percent (about 7-8 percent annualised)., which is very, very balanced when such kind of demand comes in. that's a very reasonable price increase,"" he said. this demand is expected to hold for quite some time because while cities like mumbai and pune have already seen peak demand and absorption, other markets like bengaluru, chennai and the delhi-ncr area are yet to go back to their peak cycles, providing more scope for growth. opportunities most analysts are placing their bets on large real estate developers. sankhe is positive because these developers are well-prepared with strong projects and solid balance sheets, boasting an equity ratio of just 0.3 times. this, he said, leaves them plenty of room to expand, and they are doing so by actively signing memoranda of understanding, acquiring land and partnering with smaller developers. ""despite recent stock price increases, today's valuations are underpinned by stronger fundamentals compared to previous real estate booms. additionally, pent-up demand from the 2014-2020 slowdown is driving growth in the residential sector,"" sankhe pointed out. among the large developers on analysts' lists aredlf, sobha,lodha, brigade,phoenix millsand sunteck. while brokerages like nuvama have a buy call on godrej properties, analysts at ambit have a sell call on the stock due to its ""unfavourable"" valuations. risks for most analysts tracking the sector, the challenges are currently minimal. while there may be some slowdown in buying and construction during the upcoming election season, demand could pick up as soon as customers have clarity on the results, job creation and earning capacity. according to khanna, in the long run, execution could be the sole stumbling block. ""the only challenge is continuing with the execution track record over the next two or three years because skilled labor availability will be a challenge, that's one. second, there could be a slowdown during the election period,"" he added.","the hdfc nifty realty index fund has launched its first mutual fund scheme, focusing on the realty sector. the index touched 959.10 points on april 2, led by a bullish outlook for the segment. however, the pe ratio is currently around 62.3 times against 38.2 times in april 2023. analysts are concerned about valuation, with the pe expanding rapidly over the last one year. despite this, there are positive factors supporting the sector, such as strong demand and low leverage. however, the sector could face challenges such as execution track record and election season slowdown.","The sentiment of the hdfc nifty realty index fund is **positive**.

""if at all the markets go up again from here, then eventually our equity exposure will also go up based on the momentum,"" he says. the fund has power and energy stocks such as pfc, rec, inox wind, adani power, ongc, and power grid. launched in july 2023, it has gained around 23 percent to date. here is what other thematic fund managers have to say: vikas gupta, smallcase manager and ceo, omniscience capital investment case:gupta says he was one of the early players in the power space, adding the stock to his portfolios during 2018-2020. the sector has been negative for the last 10 years because there was oversupply and less demand, among other reasons, he says. as many projects could not be completed, it also resulted in a lot of npas for power finance companies; hence, people lost interest in the segment. the bet for gupta has played out well.

""most of these companies are getting plans commissioned in the next two years, which will nearly double their revenues in the near future,"" he says but cautions that often roe in the space may look low because a lot of work that is happening is reported in the capital as work in progress.

""if you look at power costs during peak hours, they go up almost twice. this shows the pressure on demand. that means you need more power plants. till two years ago, the belief was that there was a need for more renewables. but now that everyone has understood, even europe is talking about thermal power plants and gas-based power plants. so, the entire value chain of people who are setting up, the companies who are going to fund them, are going to benefit from it,"" he says. but the key, is the price at which you are getting those businesses.

""we have to look at it from the capabilities of these companies to make the most of it and how they are moving in it. in that sense, none of these companies have moved above their peak valuations in the last cycle. so given that you have a more regulated structure on returns, which is likely to stay for another five years at least because that's what the new norms have already been out in the public domain, so in that sense, you can definitely trade at 1.8 to 2.5 times your books and all, and then if you add the kicker of renewables and all, the valuations are not expensive, and some of them can definitely see very steady growth and therefore more comfort in valuation over a longer period of time,"" doshi says. over the past year, the fund has given returns of 31 percent and over 5 percent over 132 percent. doshi says that they definitely see good growth opportunities and a large capex coming into the power space in the next five to seven years due to power demand. if india has to grow at 7-8 percent plus gdp, then it will definitely require at least 1.2 times the growth in power itself.
